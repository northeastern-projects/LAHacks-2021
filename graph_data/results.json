We employed several ideas from the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms\r\nto improve the stability and speed of convergence of the system.

This thesis explores the use of mmWave imaging for humans, which could be incorporated into autonomous driving technology for pedestrian imaging in low visibility conditions.\r\nUnfortunately, certain challenges have been identified in mmWave imaging for humans, including its low resolution, the presence of fake artifacts resulting from multipath reflections, and the vibration of the human body.

To address this problem, deep in-memory architecture (DIMA) has been designed to enhance both energy efficiency and throughput over conventional digital architectures by reading multiple bits per cycle and by employing mixed-signal processing in the periphery of the BCA. Due to its mixed-signal nature, DIMA is sensitive to transistor-level spatial process variation and data-dependent non-idealities, which circuit simulation tools fail to capture. In order to have an accurate simulation of DIMA, an emulator is developed based on a model which considers the discharge transistor current equation and normal distribution of spatial threshold voltage variation. The result of the emulator is compared with the measurement of a 65 nm CMOS prototype IC running support vector machine (SVM) on face detection dataset from The Center for Biological & Computational Learning (CBCL) at MIT and predicted the inference accuracy with an error range less than 2%.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104026", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089626000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512130000, "depositedDate": 1560574935000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "Pydima: Evaluation on machine learning algorithms on deep in-memory architecture (DIMA)", "topics": ["in-memory", "machine learning", "always-on inference", "mixed-signal", "process variations", "circuit simulation"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291796967", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/104026"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104026", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291793305", "authors": ["Tao, Cheng"], "contributors": ["Schwing, Alexander G."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "This research aims to solve the problem of predicting the long-term sequential movements of\r\nan object in an image given a force vector applied to the object.

This study reports the creative video editing as a pedagogical strategy to\r\nunderstanding threshold concepts, namely the reflexive action of the student on the understanding\r\nof threshold concepts worked and reflect on how the sharing of the explanatory video can contribute\r\nto the understanding of the threshold concept. The study is bounded in the VideoM@t project and\r\nsupported in the JuxtaLearn learning process. In the first phase, we involved ten students from the\r\n6th grade, twenty-three students from the 9th year of schooling and their mathematics teachers in\r\nthe creative video edition following the JuxtaLearn learning methodology. In the second phase, we\r\noriented a training action to a group of six math teachers, and we promoted together with 52\r\nstudents the creative edition of videos. We sought to answer the following research question: how\r\ncan creative editing and video sharing be a pedagogical strategy for understanding the threshold\r\nconcept? Given the nature of the study, development research methodology was adopted. The data\r\nwas collected through (i) direct observation, (ii) indirect observation, through video recording, (iii)\r\nthink-aloud techniques, (iv) software logging, (v) walk-through, (vi) Focus group interviews, and (vii)\r\nquestionnaires. The threshold concept identification and unfolding them into smaller stumbling\r\nblocks proved to be an essential aid for teachers to be able to help students overcome their\r\nunderstanding gaps in structuring concepts in mathematics. The results indicate that the creative\r\nedition of explanatory video by the students constitutes an appealing methodology that allows\r\nimproving the deep understanding of concepts of the area of mathematics where the students\r\npresent difficulty.

Mental health disciplines in general, and couple and family therapy in particular are paying more attention to immigration as an experience that can profoundly affect the identity and relationships of individuals and families. However, the impact of immigration has been addressed predominantly for immigrant clients. In the extant literature, much less attention has been paid to immigrants as couple and family therapists regarding how their experiences of immigration can affect clinical encounters with clients in the US. In order to fill this gap, this phenomenological dissertation study was designed to examine the clinical experiences of couple and family therapists who were born and raised outside of the US and who are clinically active in this country. Symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969; Mead, 1934) and the multicultural perspective as defined by Hardy and Laszloffy (2002) guided the development of this qualitative study which followed the stages and tasks of transcendental phenomenology (Moustakas, 1994). Thirteen immigrant couple and family therapists who were clinically active in the US volunteered for in-depth interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the transcriptions were analyzed with the assistance of MaxQDA and using conventional content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) to identify frequent and notable themes. The following major themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) the experience of immigration, (b) immigrant therapists and their clients, (c) development as a clinician, (d) relationships with colleagues and other professionals, and (e) a name for ourselves. The five major themes suggest that the exposure to different cultures during therapeutic encounters in the US and working in the midst of cultural differences affected participants\u2019 clinical work. First, findings supported previous literature that described immigrant therapists as capable of having an outsider perspective, being more aware of their assumptions, being more flexible in their definitions, and experiencing discrimination by clients and other professionals in the US. Second, findings suggest that the therapeutic encounter is a relationship where meanings between therapists and clients are exchanged which facilitates identity transformations, the debunking of stereotypes, and the negotiation of new meanings. Regarding implications, findings from this study suggest that feedback from clients, supervisors, colleagues and faculty members affect the formation of immigrant CFTs\u2019 evolving professional identities. Supervisors and faculty members in training programs should develop a more balanced view of immigrant CFT students and professionals that more closely attends to their needs and nurtures their strengths. CFT training programs and clinical supervisors should teach diversity and multiculturalism in a way that recognizes human diversity without promoting rigid categorization and divisiveness. Future research should pay closer attention to the strategies that immigrant CFTs develop that helps them clinically work in the midst of cultural differences with clients in the US.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6139", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028534000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343099000, "depositedDate": 1551244791000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Experiences of immigrant couple and family therapists clinically active in the United States: A Phenomenological Study", "topics": ["Couples Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201305, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190327009.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190327009", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6139", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6139"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190327009.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6139", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190327009.pdf"}, {"id": "344683606", "authors": ["Li, Kai", "Ni, Wei", "Tovar, Eduardo", "Jamalipour, Abbas"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "2120-01-01T00:00:00", "description": "In Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted Wireless Powered Internet of Things (IoT), the UAV is employed to charge the IoT nodes remotely via Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) and collect their data.

In this paper, we consider the resource management problem in practical scenarios, where the UAV has no a-prior information on battery levels and data queue lengths of the nodes. We formulate the resource management of UAV-assisted WPT and data collection as Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the states consist of battery levels and data queue lengths of the IoT nodes, channel qualities, and positions of the UAV. A deep Q-learning based resource management is proposed to minimize the overall data packet loss of the IoT nodes, by optimally deciding the IoT node for data collection and power transfer, and the associated modulation scheme of the IoT node.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio", "identifiers": ["oai:recipp.ipp.pt:10400.22/16382", "10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9149282"], "journals": [{"title": null, "identifiers": ["1938-1883", "issn:1938-1883"]}], "publisher": "'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)'", "relations": ["https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9149282"], "repositories": [{"id": "1954", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Reposit\u00f3rio Cient\u00edfico do Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico do Porto", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1606146354000, "metadataUpdated": 1611604543000, "depositedDate": 1604055773000}, "subjects": ["conferenceObject"], "title": "Deep Q-Learning based Resource Management in UAV-assisted Wireless Powered IoT Networks", "topics": ["Unmanned Aerial Vehicle", "Internet of Things", "Wireless power transfer", "Resource management", "Deep Qlearning"], "types": [], "year": 2120, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/344683606", "http://hdl.handle.net/10400.22/16382"], "doi": "10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9149282", "oai": "oai:recipp.ipp.pt:10400.22/16382", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "380821827", "authors": ["G\u00f3rriz, Juan M.", "Ram\u00edrez, Javier", "Ort\u00edz, Andr\u00e9s", "Mart\u00ednez-Murcia, Francisco J.", "Segovia, Fermin", "Suckling, John", "Leming, Matthew", "Zhang, Yu Dong", "\u00c1lvarez-S\u00e1nchez, Jose Ram\u00f3n", "Bologna, Guido", "Bonomini, Paula", "Casado, Fernando E.", "Charte, David", "Charte, Francisco", "Contreras, Ricardo", "Cuesta-Infante, Alfredo", "Duro, Richard J.", "Fern\u00e1ndez-Caballero, Antonio", "Fern\u00e1ndez-Jover, Eduardo", "G\u00f3mez-Vilda, Pedro", "Gra\u00f1a, Manuel", "Herrera, Francisco", "Iglesias, Roberto", "Lekova, Anna", "de Lope, Javier", "L\u00f3pez-Rubio, Ezequiel", "Mart\u00ednez-Tom\u00e1s, Rafael", "Molina-Cabello, Miguel A.", "Montemayor, Antonio S.", "Novais, Paulo", "Palacios-Alonso, Daniel", "Pantrigo, Juan J.", "Payne, Bryson R.", "de la Paz L\u00f3pez, F\u00e9lix", "Pinninghoff, Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica", "Rinc\u00f3n, Mariano", "Santos, Jos\u00e9", "Thurnhofer-Hemsi, Karl", "Tsanas, Athanasios", "Varela, Ramiro", "Ferr\u00e1ndez, Jose M."], "contributors": [], "description": "Artificial intelligence and all its supporting tools, e.g. machine and deep learning in computational intelligence-based systems, are rebuilding our society (economy, education, life-style, etc.) and promising a new era for the social welfare state.

This study reports the creative video editing as a pedagogical strategy to\r\nunderstanding threshold concepts, namely the reflexive action of the student on the understanding\r\nof threshold concepts worked and reflect on how the sharing of the explanatory video can contribute\r\nto the understanding of the threshold concept. The study is bounded in the VideoM@t project and\r\nsupported in the JuxtaLearn learning process. In the first phase, we involved ten students from the\r\n6th grade, twenty-three students from the 9th year of schooling and their mathematics teachers in\r\nthe creative video edition following the JuxtaLearn learning methodology. In the second phase, we\r\noriented a training action to a group of six math teachers, and we promoted together with 52\r\nstudents the creative edition of videos. We sought to answer the following research question: how\r\ncan creative editing and video sharing be a pedagogical strategy for understanding the threshold\r\nconcept? Given the nature of the study, development research methodology was adopted. The data\r\nwas collected through (i) direct observation, (ii) indirect observation, through video recording, (iii)\r\nthink-aloud techniques, (iv) software logging, (v) walk-through, (vi) Focus group interviews, and (vii)\r\nquestionnaires. The threshold concept identification and unfolding them into smaller stumbling\r\nblocks proved to be an essential aid for teachers to be able to help students overcome their\r\nunderstanding gaps in structuring concepts in mathematics. The results indicate that the creative\r\nedition of explanatory video by the students constitutes an appealing methodology that allows\r\nimproving the deep understanding of concepts of the area of mathematics where the students\r\npresent difficulty. The creative video editing promoted in students the development of skills such\r\nas analysis, synthesis and evaluation, as well as a deeper knowledge of the studied concepts", "identifiers": ["oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/61759", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "18290", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Universidade do Minho: RepositoriUM", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1612603436000, "metadataUpdated": 1612603436000, "depositedDate": 1571035847000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis"], "title": "Creative video editing as a pedagogical strategy to understanding threshold concepts", "topics": ["Ci\u00eancias Sociais::Ci\u00eancias da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/380766048", "http://hdl.handle.net/1822/61759"], "oai": "oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/61759", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "132076481", "authors": ["\u0e19\u0e34\u0e15\u0e22\u0e32, \u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e1e", "\u0e01\u0e34\u0e15\u0e15\u0e34\u0e28\u0e31\u0e01\u0e14\u0e34\u0e4c, \u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e1e"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "2560", "description": "\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e17\u0e38\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e38\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e27\u0e34\u0e08\u0e31\u0e22\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e40\u0e17\u0e04\u0e42\u0e19\u0e42\u0e25\u0e22\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e19\u0e32\u0e23\u0e35 \u0e1b\u0e35\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e32\u0e13 \u0e1e.\u0e28.2556-255", "identifiers": ["oai:localhost:123456789/7097", null], "publisher": "\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e02\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e28\u0e27\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e27\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e2a\u0e33\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e27\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e28\u0e27\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e40\u0e17\u0e04\u0e42\u0e19\u0e42\u0e25\u0e22\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e19\u0e32\u0e23\u0e35", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2206", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Suranaree University of Technology Intellectual Repository", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1511307264000, "metadataUpdated": 1559664875000, "depositedDate": 1510185600000}, "subjects": ["Research Reports"], "title": "A knowledge engineering approach to the recognition of genomic coding regions", "topics": ["\u0e27\u0e34\u0e28\u0e27\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49", "\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e08\u0e33", "\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e01\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e14\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e19\u0e18\u0e38\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21"], "types": [], "year": 2560, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132076481.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/132076481", "http://sutir.sut.ac.th:8080/sutir/handle/123456789/7097"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132076481.pdf", "oai": "oai:localhost:123456789/7097", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132076481.pdf"}, {"id": "291796977", "authors": ["Vijitbenjaronk, W.

The\r\nclassifier will assign a benign or malignant label to every biopsy with accuracy near 100%.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/97889", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089564000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512087000, "depositedDate": 1530910408000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "Prostate cancer diagnosis with deep learning", "topics": ["prostate cancer, deep learning, data augmentation"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291790547", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/97889"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/97889", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "210999303", "authors": ["Zhang, Yichi"], "contributors": ["Levinson, Stephen E."], "description": "Handwriting is one of the most significant communication and recording information tools in our daily\r\nlife. Considering the ubiquitous role that handwriting plays in our life, machine recognition of\r\nhandwriting has practical importance. The purpose of this research is to let the robot view the handwritten\r\ndigits, recognize them and do tasks such as calculating simple formulas depending on the digits it sees.\r\nFor the recognition part, we use the MNIST data base and apply three different algorithms from\r\nmachine learning including support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and deep neural\r\nnetwork (DNN), to perform the prediction of input handwritten digits. Different features are extracted\r\nfrom those different methods and the testing accuracy varies. By comparing the training time and the test\r\naccuracy, we can choose the best training architecture for this problem.\r\nFor the robotic part, we use the camera from the robot in the robot simulator. The robot model can\r\nvisualize the images of digits and apply the pre-trained weights from previous steps to get the predictions\r\nfor the digits and move its joints around to perform the given tasks such as simple mathematical\r\ncalculation.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104054", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1561103076000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009268000, "depositedDate": 1561006936000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "Handwriting recognition and robotic application", "topics": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning", "Recognition"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/210999303", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/104054"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104054", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158304579", "authors": ["Mehra, Bharat"], "contributors": ["Bishop, Ann Peterson"], "description": "318 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2004.These phases represent significant of LIS international doctoral students in terms of cognitive (thoughts), affective (feelings), and physical (actions) aspects.

This has led to a new trend in Artificial Intelligence towards knowledge-intensive methods such as explanation-based learning, qualitative reasoning, theory-driven machine discovery and deep-model expert systems. Knowledge-intensive systems rely on a model of the domain, called a domain theory, to fulfill their tasks. A domain theory consists of an encoding of the knowledge required by the system to draw inferences about situations of interest. The primary shortcomings of a system that relies on a domain theory are twofold: (1) The construction of an adequately complete and correct domain theory to insure a satisfactory level of performance is virtually impossible for most complex real-world domains. (2) The performance of the system is fundamentally limited by the deductive closure of the knowledge initially encoded into its domain theory and consequently the system does not perform well in underspecified or dynamically changing domains.This thesis describes a method called explanation-based theory revision for augmenting and correcting a domain theory. The method consists of detecting failures due to the inadequacies of the domain theory, hypothesizing modifications or additions to the domain theory to eliminate the failures, designing experiments to refute incorrect hypotheses, recalling previous experiences of the system to eliminate inconsistent hypotheses and selecting a best theory from the remaining theories based on aesthetic criteria. Explanation-based theory revision addresses both the problems mentioned above. It corrects and augments inadequate domain theories when failures occur. Furthermore since the deductive closure of the knowledge in the domain theory changes the system learns at the knowledge level. Explanation-based theory revision has been incorporated into a system called COAST. COAST revises qualitative theories of the physical world. COAST has been demonstrated on a number of implemented examples involving the revision of qualitative theories about physical phenomena such as evaporation, osmosis, flow of fluids, dissolving of substances, chemical decomposition of compounds and combustion.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/22579", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384578000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008619000, "depositedDate": 1356652800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Explanation-based theory revision: An approach to the problems of incomplete and incorrect theories", "topics": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/4831002", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/22579"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/22579", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "344683607", "authors": ["Li, Kai", "Ni, Wei", "Tovar, Eduardo", "Guizani, Mohsen"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "2120-01-01T00:00:00", "description": "In Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered sensor networks, a UAV can be employed to charge the ground sensors remotely via Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) and collect the sensory data. This paper focuses on trajectory planning of the UAV for aerial data collection and WPT to minimize buffer overflow at the ground sensors and unsuccessful transmission due to lossy airborne channels. Consider network states of battery levels and buffer lengths of the ground sensors, channel conditions, and location of the UAV. A flight trajectory planning optimization is formulated as a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the UAV has partial observation of the network states. In practice, the UAV-enabled sensor network contains a large number of network states and actions in POMDP while the up-to-date knowledge of the network states is not available at the UAV. To address these issues, we propose an onboard deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the realtime trajectory planning of the UAV given outdated knowledge on the network

according to Islam. It is to examine opinions of Islamic scholars regarding \u1e24ad\u012bth Maw\u1e0du\u2019 and analyze impacts of citing \u1e24ad\u012bth Maw\u1e0d\u016b\u2018 on the Faith and \u2018Ib\u0101dah Performance of Muslim Society in the five provinces of the Andaman Sea. It also gives some recommendation for the solution. This study is a qualitative research, collecting data by survey and interview. It analyzes data by resorting to principle of sciences of had\u012bth , Islamic Jurisprudence, and Tarjih. Its findings are as follows.\r\n1.\tBelief Principles and Worship according to Islam is the most important issue, which must be derived from two important sources : namely al-Quran and al-Sunnah under which they are understood in line with the interpretation of the Prophet\u2019s companions and scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah. Otherwise, it is risky for deviation towards Shirk, Bid\u2018ah, Kufr, and Khurafat.\r\n2.\t\u1e24ad\u012bth Maw\u1e0d\u016b\u2018 is a had\u012bth  that is falsely claimed or understood as a word or a story related to Prophet Mohammad   , but it is clearly proved from Takrij and Tahqiq process that they are a word from other people, which is invented intentionally for a certain purpose or is narrated from misunderstanding. Thus, \u1e24ad\u012bth  Mawdu\u2019 is occurred to only the text (matan) as well as narration (sanad) of the had\u012bth . For these reasons, this had\u012bth is not allowed to be cited as a religious sources in any matter. It is also not a valid had\u012bth  in a true sense but rather the worst one of all defected hadith. \r\n3.\tFrom a study on the Faith and \u2018Ib\u0101dah Performance of the Muslim Societies in the five provinces of Andaman, it is found that there is a citation of 42 had\u012bth Maw\u1e0d\u016b\u2018 and had\u012bth da\u2018if jiddan, It has an impact and is wrong in many layers, which can be classified as Shirk, Kufr, Bid\u2018ah, and Khurafat. In order to deal with a citation of \u1e24ad\u012bth Maw\u1e0du\u2019 on the Faith and \u2018Ib\u0101dah Performance, it proposes 8 solutions as follows; 1) to campaign in the Muslim Societies in order to make an awareness of the importance of Sunnah of the Prophet  , 2) to explain to the Muslim Societies about the endeavor of the past Islamic scholars, who strived to defend \u1e24ad\u012bth  or Sunnah of the Prophet   , 3) to support learning about high and deep levels of \u1e24ad\u012bth , 4) to organize projects and provide academic seminars among Muslim Scholars on a danger of \u1e24ad\u012bth Maw\u1e0d\u016b\u2018or Fabricated \u1e24ad\u012bth, 5) to create an awareness and provide an access to main textbooks on hadith,  6) to teach about evaluative methods of had\u012bth through different channels, 7) to provide textbooks, encyclopedia, and websites about the danger of \u1e24ad\u012bth Maw\u1e0d\u016b\u2018 or invalid sources and,  8) to propose to Islamic organizations to have an assertive policy for monitoring and preventing diffusion of the belief and religious practices that are contradicted with Islamic Principles", "identifiers": ["oai:kb.psu.ac.th:2016/11925", null], "publisher": "\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e2a\u0e07\u0e02\u0e25\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e15\u0e15\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "560", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "PSU Knowledge Bank", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1546580051000, "metadataUpdated": 1611259817000, "depositedDate": 1546485906000}, "subjects": ["Thesis"], "title": "An Analytical Study of the Impact of al-HadIth al-Mawdu\u2018 on the Faith and \u2018Ibadah Performance of Muslim Society in the 5 Provinces of the Andaman Sea", "topics": ["\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e32\u0e21", "\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e32\u0e21\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32"], "types": [], "year": 2561, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/162054856.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/162054856", "http://kb.psu.ac.th/psukb/handle/2016/11925"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/162054856.pdf", "oai": "oai:kb.psu.ac.th:2016/11925", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/162054856.pdf"}, {"id": "190322168", "authors": ["Petroka, Katherine Frances"], "contributors": ["Milliron, Brandy-Joe"], "description": "Low-income seniors residing in subsidized housing may develop unhealthy eating behaviors and experience poor health outcomes due to a lack of access to fresh produce in their local environment. Guild House West (GHW) is a Quaker-run subsidized housing facility for seniors and disabled individuals located in the West Poplar neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. GHW was established and is managed by Friends Rehabilitation Program, a Quaker-related non-profit, whose mission is to provide affordable housing and social services for seniors, low-income persons, and individuals with special needs. GHW is located in a neighborhood with low access to supermarkets but has the unique feature of a community garden implemented by the nonprofit organization Greener Partners. There is also a food pantry on site offering packaged goods to the residents once a week. Community-based participatory research was incorporated to establish a community partnership between Drexel University's Nutrition Sciences  Department, Greener Partners, and GHW. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to incorporate formative research methods to gain a better understanding of the nutrition-related needs of the population living in a subsidized housing facility for future research. The researcher determined if community-driven nutrition education programing could be implemented to facilitate improvements in dietary intake and self-management of nutrition-related chronic conditions among low-income seniors. This manuscript describes the preliminary stage of the formative research process, as the researcher collected information using ethnographic and phenomenological approaches to help inform the rest of the research process. Following 12 months of interacting directly with the GHW population, common themes and behaviors were identified. The two aspects of the case study focus on themes seen in 1) food focus groups during cooking classes 2) food pantry use and barriers to access. Focus group questions were developed and residents were invited in-person and through a weekly newsletter to participate in food focus groups by GHW management and the researcher. Participation in the GHW community food pantry was pursued initially to better understand the needs of the residents for future research/programming. A thematic analysis was performed using NVivo 10, a software package that is used to organize and manage qualitative databases. Generalizable information was gathered on the beliefs and behaviors of the GHW residents. Seven major themes and sub-themes were derived from the NVivo 10 Software data analysis of the attitudes and behaviors of the residents at GHW during food focus groups and food pantry participation. Themes included negative dietary attitudes about diet quality, challenges of change around nutrition and healthy eating, external barriers in the food environment, negative influences in the internal environment, disconnect between disease state and nutrition recommendations, difficulties of disease self-management through dietary modifications, and interest for learning new recipes to improve nutrition knowledge base. The significance of understanding the attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs surrounding the internal and external challenges to healthful eating were classified in this case study. Acknowledging the impact that barriers had on the social and personal constructs of low-income seniors residing in subsidized housing was found to be a successful strategy in informing the research process for future nutrition programming. The themes are considered generalizable to similar populations indicating that community-driven nutrition education programming can be implemented within a subsidized living setting to facilitate improvements in dietary intake and self-management of disease among low-income seniors. This research uncovered two novel concepts; residents were not familiar with healthier food options that were not culturally relevant and community tensions existed among the residents due to lack of social cohesion. Future research must consider these novel concepts while developing nutrition programming within subsidized housing facilities.M.S., Human Nutrition -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6310", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028447000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343083000, "depositedDate": 1551277204000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Facilitators and Barriers to Healthy Eating and Disease Management Among Low-Income Seniors Residing in Subsidized Housing: A Case Study", "topics": ["Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"], "types": [], "year": 201506, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190322168.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190322168", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6310", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6310"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322168.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6310", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322168.pdf"}, {"id": "190331715", "authors": ["Johnson, Cristyn A."], "contributors": ["Brody, Jean"], "description": "This thesis explores the impact that the 2008 U.S. economic recession has had on performing arts organizations. Through my research process, I compiled case studies of three mid-sized performing arts organizations based in the Mid-Atlantic for the greater purpose of examining traits successful arts organizations possessed during this economic downturn. My initial literature reviewed showed that organizations that were quick to adapt new and emerging trends and remained flexible in terms of changing market demands were the organizations which emerged the most successful through this time. However, the information I discovered through the case studies found that rather than emerging trends being utilized by successful organizations, calculated decisions such as merging organizations, hiring dedicated development staff, and transitioning board from working to governance, had instead led to the organizations\u2019 overall sustainability and growth. This paper does not serve as a guide on how to build a successful performing arts organization, as this topic can never be answered in its entirety.

Research has demonstrated that intimate relationships with women among African American heterosexual men have influenced sexual risk behaviors, such as engaging in unprotected sex and having concurrent sexual partnerships; as well as protective behaviors, such as condom use. The Close Relationship Context was utilized to frame this study. This dissertation consisted of secondary data analysis of 30 semi-structured interviews conducted for the qualitative phase of REPRESENT, a mixed methods study conducted in Philadelphia (2007 \u2013 2009). The REPRESENT study was conducted to examine the effects of gender role norms, sexual scripts and structural factors on sexual HIV risk behaviors of low-income African American heterosexual men who reside in Philadelphia. NVivo 10.0 software was used to code narratives stemming from the interviews relevant to sexually and emotionally intimate relationship experiences with women among this sample of men. The codes were subsequently refined to generate themes derived from the data. There were five dominant themes and two non-dominant themes related to relationship experiences that increased sexual risk, and four dominant themes related to relationship experiences protecting against sexual risk. Participants cited trust and length of relationship as reasons for non-condom use with main sexual partners, but cited length of association of sexual partner as reasons for non-condom use with casual sexual partners. Participants cited relationships that have developed over time as reasons for non-condom use with both main and casual sexual partners. Participants identified monogamy and HIV/STI testing in committed relationships serving as protective sexual behaviors. They also cited that having sex with casual sexual partners and complying with partners\u2019 requests and demands to use condoms as reasons to do so with their sexual partners.Dr.P.H., Public Health -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6130", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028466000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "African American Heterosexual Men's Experiences of Emotionally and Sexually Intimate Relationships with Women: Implications for Sexual HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors", "topics": ["Public Health"], "types": [], "year": 201308, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190323285.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190323285", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6130", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6130"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190323285.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6130", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190323285.pdf"}, {"id": "190329787", "authors": ["Gorsegner, Amanda"], "contributors": [], "description": "The findings presented in this publication suggest that artists and arts administrators have significant roles to play when using the arts to address climate change.

Artists do not need to maintain strict fidelity to climate change data, although there may be an inverse correlation between manipulating climate data and validation of the work to accurately comment on climate change. The contemporary climate change movement requires the integration of artists to respond to the challenges of climate change not merely as buffers between the public and the hard data but to incite a richer and more complex conversation through the cumulative impact of all art that addresses climate change.M.S., Arts Administration -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6754", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028604000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343089000, "depositedDate": 1551363654000}, "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "title": "Role of art in the global climate change movement", "topics": ["Arts Management", "Climate change", "Reformers", "Green movement", "Art", "Scientists"], "types": [], "year": 201603, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190329787.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190329787", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6754", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6754"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190329787.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6754", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190329787.pdf"}, {"id": "190334543", "authors": ["Hernandez, Ana"], "contributors": ["Davey, Maureen P.", "Johnson, Eric"], "description": "Using the Cross Racial Identity Model (Cross, 1991), Multidimensional Model of Racial Identity (Sellers, et al. 1998), and Helm's White Racial Identity Model (Helms, 1995), this web-based quantitative cross-sectional survey study was designed to examine the associations between selfreported skin color, racial discrimination, racial identity, parental racial socialization, selfesteem, and depressive symptoms in a convenience sample of 205 United States of America (USA) born Latinos (ages 18-25). Most participants were between 18 and 21 years old (64%) and were women (78.5%). Participants were asked to self-identify their race and approximately one-third [27% (n=56)] reported their race as White, and only 10.2% (n=21) reported their race as Black. Most self-reported their skin color as a lighter shade (89% rated their skin color between 1 and 4) and 31.2% (n=64) reported their skin color as \"2=very light\". Only 10.8% (n=22) reported their skin color as 5 and above (darker skin color). Approximately one-quarter reported their parent's country of origin is Mexico 24.9% (n=51) and others reported their parent's country of origin is the United States of America (15.1% n=31), or various countries in Latin America (e.g., Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Honduras, Cuba) and European Countries (e.g., Scotland, Spain, Ireland, Hungary). More than half were single when they completed the survey (58.5%), 39% were in a relationship, and 2.9% were married. Approximately, 70% reported they spoke another language while growing up; 64.9% reported speaking Spanish. Most were in college when they completed the survey (68.8% n=141). More than half reported their annual income as less than $10,000 (n=138; 67.3%) and approximately half reported their family's social economic status as working class (43.9%). Participants first completed a demographic questionnaire and then 5 valid and reliable self-report surveys to examine their skin color, racial identity, perceived racial discrimination, parental racial socialization, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Results suggest that racial identity, specifically the self-hatred and anti-dominant stages of the cross identity stages of development, and not skin color or parental racial socialization is a significant mediator between perceived racial discrimination and self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Participants who perceived more racial discrimination and who were in the self-hatred stage tended to report more depressive symptoms (partial mediation). Results of the second mediation analysis suggest that the self-hatred and anti-dominant scales are significantly associated with lower self-esteem and is a fully mediated model because the racial discrimination path was not significant. Thus, for USA born Latinos who report experiencing racial discrimination, the more grounded in self-hatred or anti-dominant identities, the lower their self-esteem and the more depressive symptoms they tend to experience. This is a noteworthy finding which supports Cross's (1991) racial identity development. Results also suggest that parental socialization towards equality despite racial differences is a significant predictor of higher self-esteem and less depressive symptoms. This dissertation study has important implications for family therapists who are working with young adult USA born Latinos. First, more comprehensive clinical assessments should be done to better understand Latinos' experiences of racial discrimination, racial identity, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Clinicians should focus on the importance of parental socialization toward equality, in particular when Latino youth report experiencing discrimination, depressive symptoms, and lower self-esteem. In future research studies, two or more racial identity models should be used to capture the diverse ways Latinos tend to racially identify in the USA. Studies should also be designed to prospectively evaluate the importance of racial identity development over time from childhood to young adulthood to better understand Latino mental health and well-being in order to develop culturally sensitive family prevention programs for parents and youth.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6135", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028715000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Latino Skin Color: The Role of Discrimination, Racial identity, and Parental racial Socialization on Self Esteem and Depression", "topics": ["Family Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201411, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190334543.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190334543", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6135", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6135"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190334543.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6135", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190334543.pdf"}, {"id": "190333012", "authors": ["Gillespie, Bob"], "contributors": ["Flemke, Kimberly", "Davey, Maureen"], "description": "Using General Systems Theory (Bertalanffy, 1968) and Phenomenology (Husserl, 1913/1931), this qualitative phenomenological study examined the relational effects of mindfulness training when one partner completed an 8-week, hospital based Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR, Kabat-Zinn, 1990) within the last 6 months. In a sample of 12 couples, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with: a) recent MBSR graduates, b) their intimate partners, and c) both members of the couple together. The recent MBSR graduates were novel meditators who had limited previous mindfulness experience before taking the MBSR training and included 7 female and 6 male MBSR graduates. Ten heterosexual couples and 2 same sex couples participated in the study, and the average relationship length was 14.5 years. Over 95% of the participants were White, and 62.5% had graduate degrees. Before the interviews, all couples completed the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Busby et al., 1995), which indicated that 6 out of 12 couples were relationally distressed. A modified version of the interpretative phenomenological analysis method (Smith et al., 2009) informed the data analysis. The following major themes emerged for the MBSR graduates: 1) awareness of emotional reactivity; 2) creating space and time; 3) making different choices; and 4) humility and moments of connection. Findings confirmed that self-awareness and emotional regulation are not only major outcomes of mindfulness training, but could also be pathways to relationship growth. The intensity and reactivity of intimate partner relationships can offer both opportunities and challenges for MBSR participants trying to integrate mindfulness into their daily lives. Although intimate partners observed improved emotional balance in the graduates, their descriptions of the benefits of MBSR training were diluted compared to the graduates' descriptions. The intimate partners revealed that behavioral shifts in the graduates were emerging, but were limited in scale--suggesting that individual outcomes of MBSR training do not automatically transfer to relationship outcomes. Developing more mindfulness-enhanced couple interventions that prioritize conjoint participation and emphasize relational outcomes may harness the potential relational benefits of mindfulness practice. Future research should focus on the potential differences between distressed and non-distressed couples and include more diverse samples of couples.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6133", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028680000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "The Relational Effects of Mindfulness Training: A Phenomenological Study", "topics": ["Marital Therapy", "Mindfulness", "Couples Therapy", "Family Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201302, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190333012.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190333012", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6133", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6133"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190333012.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6133", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190333012.pdf"}, {"id": "190326802", "authors": ["Ford, Tanesha M."], "contributors": [], "description": "The question set forth in this thesis is, \u201cWhat are the unique obstacles Black theater experiences in the 21st century and how can they can create a symbiotic relationship with their communities for the potential sustainability of both?\u201d Its purpose is to investigate the root challenges Black theater experiences in achieving sustainability in America, to discern how much American racial turmoil has affected the Black community and therefore Black theater, and to identify methods by which Black theater can reverse engineer a path to a symbiotic relationship with their communities in order to consistently achieve the sustainability of both. This thesis found that Black theaters in America are far less represented than their Eurocentric counterparts. Black theaters memberships within theater industry trade organizations (i.e., League of Resident Theaters and Theater Communications Group) are not reflective of the number of Black theaters operating in America. Black theaters represent approximately 13% of theater community, but less than 2% have memberships in industry groups. Black theaters are also disproportionally less visible than their Eurocentric counterparts. In this era of almost immediate digital access, accessing the existence of or information on theaters for and by the African American Diaspora is nominal at best. The national databases researched for this thesis; League of Resident Theatres, Theater Communications Group, Actors Equity and others, do not either have Black theaters listed within them, or do not signify the existence a theater as a Black theater. Nor is there any empirical data specifically on why this disparity exists in the theater community. However, this thesis found a correlation between the success or failure of the Black communities compared to the success or failure of Eurocentric communities and the success or failure of Black theaters compared to Eurocentric theaters. This disparity of representation of Black theater is a reflection of racial inequality in American culture. When identifying challenges in the Black community I found that systemic racism leads to economic inequality (African American household income in America consistently less than Eurocentric household incomes Figure 6 Figure 7, which ultimately leads to failing communities Figure 4. This same paradigm occurs in Black theater yet manifests slightly differently: Systemic racism leads to economic inequality (individual donor priorities shift to need base reasoning, audience participation from the community dissipates from, in part, lack of funding) which leads to failing communities (Black theaters struggle to earn income through ticket sales and/or programming as their primary constituent suffers). This thesis recommends that Black theaters return to community engagement rather than audience engagement. Engaging into the community, being an integral part of the the functionality of the community, not only can Black theater be able to develop a stable business model but in turn be a catalyst for the sustainability within the community. Recommendations include: (1) Changing the narrative to achieving stability versus success, (1a) Contributed income, mission and vision, and achieving a healthy longevity are how Black theaters can achieve sustainability, (1b) Black theater needs to be mobile, innovative, inclusive and civic minded in order to survive in today\u2019s techno-distracted society, (2) Choose \u201cCommunity Engagement\u201d. The act of taking a group of people from the same place, purpose, goals or interests, and presenting material that reflects that place, purposes, goals or interests to maintain their attention and interest for a certain amount of time, (3) Civic Engagement using the resources readily available within the arts community designed specifically for the communities Black theater serves, ( i.e. creative placemaking) to further strengthen the organization and in turn the community it serves.M.S., Arts Administration -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6752", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028530000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343089000, "depositedDate": 1551363654000}, "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "title": "What are the unique obstacles Black theater experiences in the 21st century and how can they can create a symbiotic relationship with their communities for the potential sustainability of both?", "topics": ["Arts Management", "Black theater", "Racism", "Regional economic disparities", "Political participation"], "types": [], "year": 201603, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190326802.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190326802", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6752", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6752"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190326802.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6752", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190326802.pdf"}, {"id": "158322009", "authors": ["Lin, Meng"], "contributors": ["Lazebnik, Svetlana"], "description": "Recent developments on deep learning have enabled generative models to capture distribution of \r\nrelatively complex datasets.

Since probabilistic reasoning and inference is a foundational technology of statistical learning programs, adoption of probabilistic programming systems has been growing in the past few years. Pyro is a commonly used probabilistic programming system written in Python that is based on the PyTorch deep learning framework and has become very popular for machine learning applications. However, since Pyro uses a deep learning framework to sample from distributions, there is a need to evaluate the approximate nature of computations and the resilience of probabilistic programs. Additionally, there is also a significant need to systemically test probabilistic programs to identify major errors.\r\nIn this thesis, we systemically evaluate, test, and analyze Pyro probabilistic inference functions and programs. Since mutation testing is a well-established approach to test software against fault injections, we apply mutations to Pyro inference functions by using MutPy, a mutation testing tool for Python programs. Specifically, we use three popular inference programs as our testing suite and conduct mutation injection experiments on the Pyro inference library. Next, we analyze the data corruption and the amount of error introduced by mutations on inference programs.

It also enables user access control\r\nprivileges as a security measure for deep chain learning. Performance is evaluated for three use cases\r\nincluding auto insurance and healthcare applications. Results show that the distribution of inference\r\ntasks of component images among multiple parties lead to an almost linear reduction in cost, when\r\ncompared to the control variable, which is a centralized, sequential mode of execution.

This challenge demands a computationally efficient solution to enable machine learning or deep learning for the edge.\r\nTowards this goal, this research focused on developing a system to accelerate video inference by utilizing deep in memory architecture (DIMA) ICs designed and prototyped recently in our research group. The DIMA IC embeds mixed-signal compute blocks within SRAM memory array to accelerate machine learning models for image classification with 3.1x higher power efficiency and 2.1x lower inference latency. While DIMA IC achieved fast inference on single cropped images, its overall test setup was not optimized for video inference. To address this issue, we replaced the original MCU + PC in the previous setup with a Raspberry Pi and enabled it to directly process image information and control the chip. As a result, the system performance improved from more than 10 seconds per image to around 13 ms inference time. This also enabled us to complete the system with real camera input. With frames streaming into the Raspberry Pi, it will preprocess the image and regional proposal for the chip.

Assessing and treating patients\u2019 unmet emotional needs is a national focus in oncology care today. The intervention provided patients with an opportunity to portray their feelings and identify coping skills artistically through a creative process. Art therapy is based on the theory that the human mind tends to experience intrusive and avoidant stress response symptoms when faced with adverse events, such as a life-threatening illness. Creative expression can help patients reintegrate their sense of self and strengthen personal attributes. To evaluate the intervention, a repeated measures randomized controlled trial design was employed. Sixty consenting women were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the six-session Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy intervention group or the standard care control group. Results suggest that Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy may help decrease emotional distress and enhance spiritual well-being in female cancer patients during active oncology treatment. Positive trends in the data were present, but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups for the two main variables. Small treatment effects were found for Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy on participants\u2019 psychological well-being. However, one subscale measure revealed statistically significant greater improvements in Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy participants\u2019 spiritual wellbeing compared to the standard care control participants. Additionally, 30% of art therapy participants reported post-intervention emotional distress scores that were below the clinical range for emotional distress, compared with only 5% of standard care control participants, suggesting that Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy has clinical significance. Analysis of limited narrative data from exit interviews contributed to positive trends in emotional distress, suggesting that emotional needs were met for the majority of Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy participants.Ph.D., Creative Arts Therapies -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6147", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028450000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343099000, "depositedDate": 1551244791000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "The Effects of Self-Book\u00a9 Art Therapy on Emotional Distress in Female Cancer Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial", "topics": ["Art Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201503, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190322343.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190322343", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6147", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6147"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322343.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6147", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322343.pdf"}, {"id": "344683594", "authors": ["Koubaa, Anis", "Ammar, Adel", "Benjdira, Bilel", "Al Hadid, Abdullatif", "Kawaf, Belal", "Al Yahri, Saleh Ali", "Babiker, Abdelrahman", "Assaf, Koutaiba", "Ba Ras, Mohannad"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "2120-01-01T00:00:00", "description": "In the Muslim community, the prayer (i.e. Salat) is the second pillar of Islam, and it is the most essential and fundamental worshiping activity that believers have to perform five times a day. From a gestures' perspective, there are predefined human postures that must be performed in a precise manner. However, for several people, these postures are not correctly performed, due to being new to Salat or even having learned prayers in an incorrect manner. Furthermore, the time spent in each posture has to be balanced. To address these issues, we propose to develop an artificial intelligence assistive framework that guides worshippers to evaluate the correctness of the postures of their prayers. This paper represents the first step to achieve this objective and addresses the problem of the recognition of the basic gestures of Islamic prayer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The contribution of this paper lies in building a dataset for the basic Salat positions, and train a YOLOv3 neural network for the recognition of the gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that the mean average precision attains 85% for a training dataset of 764 images of the different postures.

Monitoring of animal life with image recognition in natural habitats is essential for animal health and production. Currently, Sheep Pain Facial Expression Scale (SPFES) has become the focus of monitoring sheep from facial expression. In contrast, pain level estimation from facial expression is an efficient and reliable mark of animal life. However, the manual assessment is lack of accuracy, time-consuming, and monotonous. Hence, the recent advancement of deep learning in computer vision helps to classify facial expression as fast and accurate. In this paper, we proposed a sheep face dataset and framework that uses transfer learning with fine-tuning for automating the classification of normal (no pain) and abnormal (pain) sheep face images. Current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) based architectures are used to train the sheep face dataset. The data augmentation, L2 regularization, and fine-tuning has been used to prepare the models. The experimental results related to the sheep facial expression dataset achieved 100% training, 99.69% validation, and 100% testing accuracy using the VGG16 model. While employing other pre-trained models, we gained 93.10% to 98.4% accuracy. Thus, it shows that our proposed model is optimal for high-precision classification of normal and abnormal sheep faces and can check on a comprehensive dataset.

Wearable sensors positioned on both feet were used to acquire the gait data from 15 IPD, 15 VaP, and 15 healthy subjects. A comparative classification analysis was performed by applying two supervised machine learning algorithms: Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). The decisional space was composed of the gait variables, with or without neuropsychological evaluation (Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score), top-ranked in an error incremental analysis. In the classification task of characterizing parkinsonian gait by distinguishing between patients (IPD+VaP) and healthy control, from the all strides classification of the gait performed by the person, high accuracy (93% with or without MoCA) was obtained for both algorithms. In the classification task of the two groups of patients (VaP vs. IPD), DBN classifier achieved higher performance (73% with MoCA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on gait classification that includes a VaP group. DBN classifiers are not frequently applied in literature to similar studies, but the results here obtained demonstrate that the use of DBN classifiers based on gait analysis is promising to be a good support to the neurologist in distinguishing VaP and IPD.This work was partially supported by the projects NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000026 (DeM) and NORTE-01- 0145-FEDER-000016 (NanoSTIMA financed by the Regional Operational Program of the North (NORTE2020), under PORTUGAL2020 and FEDER", "identifiers": ["oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/67258", "10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621466"], "journals": [{"title": null, "identifiers": ["2156-1125", "issn:2156-1125"]}], "publisher": "'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)'", "relations": ["https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8621466"], "repositories": [{"id": "18290", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Universidade do Minho: RepositoriUM", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1612603842000, "metadataUpdated": 1612603842000, "depositedDate": 1602855842000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/conferencePaper"], "title": "Artificial neural networks classification of patients with parkinsonism based on gait", "topics": ["Multiple Layer Perceptrons", "Multiple Layer Perceptrons", "Belief Net-works", "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease", "Vascular Parkinsonism", "Walking", "Deep Belief Networks", "Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas::Outras Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas", "Ci\u00eancias Naturais::Ci\u00eancias da Computa\u00e7\u00e3o e da Informa\u00e7\u00e3o", "Science & Technology"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/380792404", "http://hdl.handle.net/1822/67258"], "doi": "10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621466", "oai": "oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/67258", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291773070", "authors": ["Mehra, Bharat"], "contributors": ["Bishop, Ann Peterson"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "318 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2004.These phases represent significant of LIS international doctoral students in terms of cognitive (thoughts), affective (feelings), and physical (actions) aspects.

This has important implications for how clinicians, educators, and researchers come to understand the relational well-being of African American lesbian families within socio-historical, cultural and political contexts. Specifically, it has implications for understanding the effects of anti-gay agendas at the intersections of race, gender, sexual orientation, and class.\nThis study utilized a phenomenological methodology with an intersectional perspective to explore the effects of anti-gay discourse, legislation and constitutional amendments on the emotional well-being (i.e., how one feels about their sexual orientation and/or sexual identity) and relational well-being (i.e., how the relationships with others are impacted) of African-American lesbian women. Thirty face-to-face interviews were conducted in the homes and/or communities of the participants in the following states: Pennsylvania (8), North Carolina (8), Maryland (8), New Jersey (4) and the District of Columbia (2).\nAnalysis of the data indicated that the self-identified African American lesbian women who partici-pated in this study were variously affected by anti-gay discourse, legislation and constitutional amendments. The effects of the phenomena ranged from no emotional connection to feelings of a personal affront. The majority of participants felt so disconnected from the movement that, initially, they saw no need to get politi-cally involved. They shared that they did not identify with the marriage equality movement because the issues that were endemic in their lives and the lives of other African Americans in their communities were not a part of the discourse on marriage equality (e.g., economic disparities, afford-able housing and safe communities for their families, equal employment opportunities, quality education for their children, homeless for LGBTQ youth, HIV/AIDS awareness/prevention and legal protections for transgendered individuals). While they sup- ported the main goal of the movement they did not see representations of African American lesbian women and families in the discourse nor in the media campaigns for marriage equality. Therefore, they did not identify with the movement for they viewed it as one based primarily on the agenda of White gay men.\nThis lack of identification with the movement held true for all of the participants unless they found themselves in the midst of a statewide marriage amendment campaign or they became aware of the limited state a federal benefits attached to their legally recognized relationship status (marriage or civil union). These were the turning points for many of the participants. Nearly 57% of the participants had become so incensed by what they viewed as attempts to legislate discrimination and mislead the public regarding the intent of the proposed amendments that they felt compelled to get involved in community organizing and political advocacy for marriage equality. Some of them testified in front of state legislatures and others worked at the polls on Election Day, held fundraisers, worked at phone banks and developed a website where people were invited to share their thoughts and feelings on marriage equality. The website was linked to other sites where people could go to obtain information on marriage equality and the proposed amendment. The participants were driven by a need to educate themselves and the public on the potential benefits and consequences of proposed legislation and public policies.\nThe personal accounts of the African American lesbian women who participated in this study invites the reader to analyze the effects of anti-gay legislation from different viewpoints. For in spite of similar intersecting racial, gendered, and sexual identities; the participants' experiences of the phenomena were shaped by their respective sociocultural, historical, political, and legal contexts, the geographic locations that the participants navigated on a daily basis and their life cycle stages (young children, adult children, no children, and their relationship status). The findings also highlighted how instrumental local and national civil rights organizations (e.g., National Black Justice Coalition, the NAACP and the Human Rights Campaign) were in expanding the discourse on marriage equality to ensure that the diverse voices and faces within LGBTQ communities were an integral part of the movement.\nThe ultimate goal of the study was to center the voices and experiences of African American lesbian women regarding the effects of anti-gay discourses and legislation and to reduce the gap in Couple and Family Therapy professional journals on this segment of the population. Reducing the gap in the literature can contribute to the development of new knowledge on the effects of anti-gay agendas enhancing the ability of clinicians, researchers and social justice advocates to develop culturally sensitive protocols to service the needs of African American lesbian women and their families.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6138", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028578000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343099000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Bridging the Gaps: How Does Anti-Gay Discourse and Legislation Affect the Emotional and Relational Well-Being of African-American Lesbian Women and Family", "topics": ["Family Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201311, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190328744.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190328744", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6138", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6138"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190328744.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6138", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190328744.pdf"}, {"id": "145237667", "authors": ["Almeida, Joana", "Fantini, Alvino E.", "Sim\u00f5es, Ana Raquel", "Costa, Nilza"], "contributors": [], "description": "This paper examines how the addition of intercultural interventions\r\ncarried out throughout European credit-bearing exchange\r\nprogrammes can enhance sojourners\u2019 development of intercultural\r\ncompetencies, and it explores how both formal and non-formal\r\npedagogical interventions may be designed and implemented.\r\nSuch interventions were conducted at a Portuguese university with\r\n31 sojourners throughout one academic year, and their impact was\r\nassessed using a mixed methods research design.

Since probabilistic reasoning and inference is a foundational technology of statistical learning programs, adoption of probabilistic programming systems has been growing in the past few years. Pyro is a commonly used probabilistic programming system written in Python that is based on the PyTorch deep learning framework and has become very popular for machine learning applications. However, since Pyro uses a deep learning framework to sample from distributions, there is a need to evaluate the approximate nature of computations and the resilience of probabilistic programs. Additionally, there is also a significant need to systemically test probabilistic programs to identify major errors.\r\nIn this thesis, we systemically evaluate, test, and analyze Pyro probabilistic inference functions and programs. Since mutation testing is a well-established approach to test software against fault injections, we apply mutations to Pyro inference functions by using MutPy, a mutation testing tool for Python programs. Specifically, we use three popular inference programs as our testing suite and conduct mutation injection experiments on the Pyro inference library. Next, we analyze the data corruption and the amount of error introduced by mutations on inference programs. We provide a collective study of mutation tolerance of Pyro inference functions and programs where we also analyze mutation operators of MutPy and high-order mutations.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104038", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089627000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512130000, "depositedDate": 1560834131000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "A quantitative study of mutation and fault tolerance of pyro inference programs", "topics": ["Probabilistic Inference", "Mutation Testing", "Fault Tolerance"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291796976", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/104038"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104038", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158322032", "authors": ["Wang, Bangqi"], "contributors": ["Parameswaran, Aditya"], "description": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers and the second leading\r\ncause of death among American men.

Approximately half of the participants were females (54%) and most participants identified themselves as heterosexual (88.5%), White (78.7%) and Christian (55.7%). The participants\u2019 ages were distributed as follows: 19% were less than 39 years old; 21.8% were between 40 and 49 years old; 23% were between 50 and 59; 25.9% were between 60 and 69 years old, 6.3% were older than 70 years old; 7 participants did not identify their age in the survey. Approximately 60% identified their theoretical style of supervision as \u201cintegrative\u201d, approximately 20% reported their style as post-modern, and approximately 5% each identified their styles as Bowenian, Structural, Strategic, or Contextual. The experience of the participants (in years) as clinical supervisors was as follows: 35.6% had less than 10 years experience; 41.4% had between 11 and 21 years experience; 15.5% had 22 to 30 years experience; 6.3% had more than 31 years of clinical experience; and 2 participants did not complete this part of the survey. Finally, the self-reported sexual scripts of participants were as follows: 59.2% reported being liberal; 24.7% reported being traditional; 10.9% reported being conservative or religious; and 9 participants did not complete this part of the survey. Participants completed one survey for this study. The survey included questions about supervisors\u2019 demographic information, sexual scripts (values), and experiences with sexual attraction in supervision. Survey questions were designed to explore supervisors\u2019 levels of comfort with sexual attraction, the role of \u201cself of the therapist\u201d training in increasing supervisors\u2019 awareness of their own sexual scripts, and abilities to make sound clinical decisions. The survey also examined how supervisors\u2019 awareness of socio-cultural messages (cultural sexual scripts) influence their comfort (i.e., less emotional reactivity) with being sexually attracted to supervisees; and the resources (e.g., training, codes of ethics, or supervision) that have helped supervisors manage sexual attraction to supervisees. The results of the study demonstrated poor reliability of measure and very weak associations among supervisors\u2019 sexual scripts, comfort, training and management of sexual attraction towards supervisees. The psychometrics of this study was not sound. Furthermore, in order to determine whether supervisors\u2019 sexual scripts, comfort, or training were directly associated with their management of sexual attraction towards supervisees, the variables which had the highest correlations with five management parameters were analyzed in linear regression models. Nevertheless, the results produced very low r-squared values (ranging from .07 to .057), indicating little, if any, explanation of the variance in the management parameters. As a result, linear regression models could not be used to predict how supervisors manage their sexual attraction towards supervisees. In future studies, other variables may be explored in lieu of or in combination with the variables addressed in this study to improve the predictability of management through regression models with a reliable valid survey and a representative sample (probability) of AAMFT approved supervisors.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6317", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028451000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343095000, "depositedDate": 1551277204000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Family Therapy Supervisors\u2019 Sexual Attraction Towards Supervisees", "topics": ["Family Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201506, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190322433.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190322433", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6317", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6317"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322433.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6317", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322433.pdf"}, {"id": "190323015", "authors": ["Zeytinoglu, Senem"], "contributors": ["Davey, Maureen P."], "description": "This study was designed to describe the experiences of both mothers and fathers who are currently caring for an infant (12 months old) or young child (up to 4 years old) who was born with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P). The biopsychosocial approach, the Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation, and transcendental phenomenology guided this study. A convenience sample consisted of 17 couples (10 prenatal and 7 postnatal) who previously volunteered for an ongoing longitudinal quantitative study at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [PI: Dr. Canice E. Crerand, PhD (2008). Psychosocial adjustment in parents of infants with cleft lip and/or palate: The impact of prenatal versus postnatal diagnosis]. Couples completed a consent form, a demographic self-report survey, and the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale and then participated in in-depth interviews. The timing of the CLP diagnosis, the birth, and the initial stages after birth were reported as the most challenging periods for both prenatal and postnatal couples, unless their children still had ongoing developmental delays. The initial stages immediately following the birth were reported as more stressful for the postnatal diagnosis group because they had no time to prepare. Course of treatment, feeding, and social stigma were reported as major sources of stress for all 17 couples. Findings suggest that, regardless of the timing of the diagnosis, couples could benefit from (1) health professional's calm demeanor when first delivering the CL/P diagnosis, because it affects how parents perceive the CL/P, which later determines how they cope and problem solve; (2) an initial information session with both parents at the time of the diagnosis; (3) peer support from other couples to reduce their feelings of isolation; (4) help from health professionals to alleviate any self-blame, especially for the mothers; and (5) help for couples who are more distressed at diagnosis and especially during the first year after birth, such as regular screening and referrals for couple-based interventions to promote secure attachment and better coping. Finally, future research should include more racially and economically diverse samples of couples to develop culturally sensitive intervention programs.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6144", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028463000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343099000, "depositedDate": 1551244791000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Experiences of Couples Having a Young Child with Cleft Lip and/or Palate, Comparing Prenatal and Postnatal Diagnosis Groups: A Phenomenological Study", "topics": ["Family Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201405, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190323015.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190323015", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6144", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6144"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190323015.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6144", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190323015.pdf"}, {"id": "4832002", "authors": ["Mabry, Linda"], "contributors": ["Stake, Robert E."], "description": "Performance assessment has quickly become a critical topic in education because of the promises of advocates, dissatisfaction with standardized testing, and desires for meaningful evaluation of student achievement consistent with good curricula and pedagogy. Amid many new assessment practices stands a rare, mature program: the Rite of Passage Experience (R.O.P.E.), a year-long assessment of seniors at a small, alternative public high school in Racine, Wisconsin named Walden III: In the Process of Discovery.Empirical evidence of the validity of inferences of achievement formed by R.O.P.E. assessment teams was sought by means of a validation and a case study. Extensive observations, interviews, and document analysis focused on R.O.P.E. assessment events, perceptions of assessors and assessees, and contexts. Particular attention was paid to demonstrations of mastery and portfolios of a sample, partly purposeful and partly randomized, of 11 students.From voluminous data, the following assertions were drawn. (a) Inferences of student achievement arising from R.O.P.E. assessments were substantially valid, based on deep familiarity with seniors' academic and personal accomplishments in 16 areas. (b) R.O.P.E. exhibited extremely strong consequential validity. Direct educational benefits to students included self-initiated learning and focused preparation for their post-secondary goals. Educational and transformative benefits to students actually outweighed R.O.P.E.'s assessment value. R.O.P.E. also enhanced coherence of the school's educational efforts. (c) Only naturally occurring reliability is valuable. Efforts aimed at raising reliability tend to be educationally counterproductive and to compromise validity because they standardize rather than individualize, drawing attention away from students' unique achievements. R.O.P.E. exhibited strong reliability despite an absence of standardizing factors usually assumed necessary to achieve satisfactory levels of reliability. Contrary to psychometric dogma, a claim is made that reliability is neither necessary nor sufficient for validity. (d) Education needs to emphasize personalized and proleptic student assessment, including individualized standards, and to deemphasize standardized test scores. The validity of R.O.P.E.-based inferences was closely related to the extraordinary personalization of the assessment process.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23579", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384580000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008624000, "depositedDate": 1305241200000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Performance assessment and inferences of achievement.

While these techniques can achieve reasonable performance on servers or workstations equipped with multiple GPUs, they cannot be easily deployed on edge or IoT platforms. This challenge demands a computationally efficient solution to enable machine learning or deep learning for the edge.\r\nTowards this goal, this research focused on developing a system to accelerate video inference by utilizing deep in memory architecture (DIMA) ICs designed and prototyped recently in our research group. The DIMA IC embeds mixed-signal compute blocks within SRAM memory array to accelerate machine learning models for image classification with 3.1x higher power efficiency and 2.1x lower inference latency. While DIMA IC achieved fast inference on single cropped images, its overall test setup was not optimized for video inference. To address this issue, we replaced the original MCU + PC in the previous setup with a Raspberry Pi and enabled it to directly process image information and control the chip. As a result, the system performance improved from more than 10 seconds per image to around 13 ms inference time. This also enabled us to complete the system with real camera input. With frames streaming into the Raspberry Pi, it will preprocess the image and regional proposal for the chip.

The integration of green building equipment and systems such as geothermal heat pumps and water-efficient faucets often improves the social and environmental performances of housing units; however they can increase their initial cost and life cycle cost. Therefore, decision-makers need to carefully analyze and optimize the potential tradeoffs between the social, environmental, and economic performances of housing units. \r\nThe main goal of this study is to develop novel multi-objective models for optimizing the sustainability of single-family housing units that represent 66% of the residential housing inventory in the US. To accomplish this goal, the research objectives of this study are to develop (1) an innovative housing social impact model that is capable of generating and analyzing optimal tradeoffs between the social quality of life for housing residents and the life cycle cost of housing; (2) a novel housing environmental performance model for maximizing the environmental performance of housing units while minimizing their initial cost; (3) a multi-objective optimization model that provides the capability of generating optimal tradeoffs among the three housing sustainability objectives of social quality-of-life, environmental performance, and life cycle cost; and (4) a scalable and expandable parallel computing framework that provides the capability of reducing the computational time of optimizing housing sustainability decisions and transforming this optimization problem from an intractable problem to a feasible and practical one. \r\n \r\nThe performances of these developed models and framework were analyzed and refined using case studies of single-family housing units. The results of these performance evaluations illustrated that the developed optimization models were capable of generating a wide range of optimal solutions, where each identifies an optimal configuration of design and construction decisions that provides an optimal tradeoff among the three housing sustainability objectives.

The emphasis of the work is on teaching effectiveness  which I tie to the specific beliefs of teachers, and to how these beliefs encourage reluctant student motivation and engagement. This study is built upon several rational concepts. First, the classroom teacher can and does have a direct impact on the effectiveness of a learning session. Second, the words and actions of a teacher are only manifestations of a deeper dynamic and are therefore not essential qualities of instruction. The third is that effective practice can be experienced, understood, and communicated. Moustakas's (1990) methodological steps are leveraged to reach a deep understanding of my own teaching experience, to cast these experiences in contrast to the accounts of others in the student intervention research and teaching literature, and to communicate the resulting understanding to the readers of this report. The results of this research include (a) a thorough communication of the nature and qualities of reluctant students and their classrooms, (b) an integrated discussion of the role of teacher within these classrooms, and (c) a discussion of teacher beliefs that encourage teaching effectiveness. These identified beliefs include the notion that teaching relationships are both personal and challenging, dialogue (internal, between students, and between teacher and student) is essential and is itself learning, quality in aims and goals must be a consideration in effective planning and practice, all students have limitless potential, and effective practitioners by nature work to improve their practice on a continuing basis.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/79989", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1528754420000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009037000, "depositedDate": 1458086400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Teaching Reluctant Learners", "topics": ["Education, Mathematics"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158303036", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/79989"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/79989", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "190332626", "authors": ["Chilton, Gioia Connell"], "contributors": ["Gerber, Nancy"], "description": "This arts-based research study explored the dynamics of expressing positive emotions, within the intersubjective art making process. The study addressed a multifaceted problem involving a gap in knowledge about the process of emotional expression through art making, which is key to therapeutic action in art therapy. The design was arts-based research, as art making was the primary means of inquiry. The philosophy and methodology of arts-based research were employed to explore the emotional aspects of intersubjective experience. Following the traditions of arts based research, the meaning-making capacity of creating art was used to illuminate the process of artistic creation in response to the research questions. The research was conducted following approval by the Drexel University IRB. Five English-speaking adults who were professional art therapists were recruited as key informants. The method of data generation involved an initial two hour Art Interview, followed by reflexive memoing and responsive art-making by the researcher and a subsequent second Art Interview with co-researchers. Methodological credibility procedures consisted of member checking and peer review. The data analysis processes involved: 1) traditional use of qualitative data analysis practices, such as the use of MAXQDA-10 software for coding for themes and 2) arts-based research data analysis methods. The analysis of the interview data, artistic data, artistic responses and a creative synthesis addressed the research question in the form of visual art pieces, poetry, a video, three stories, four themes, and a theoretical model. Overall, the verbal and artistic analysis of the data resulted in thematic categories that represent the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective art therapy relationship. Based upon the findings, the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective context was conceptualized as an iterative process beginning with metaphors of life and nature, the development of trust, revelations of emotion, empathic responses, reflexivity and joint artmaking creating and causing destabilization, deconstruction, reconstruction, and reimagining of perceptions and meanings. An emerging, holistic view of emotions and the transformative capacity of artmaking in a context of relational trust were discussed. Clinical applications included consideration of the therapeutic use of response art and joint artmaking. The limitations of the study were also described, as was methodological criteria for arts-based research. Overall, this expanding discourse helped to identify ways art therapy works. The study achieved its aim by contributing knowledge to our understanding of how emotions emerge, are expressed, and assigned meaning within an art therapy relational context.Ph.D., Creative Arts Therapies -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6128", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028667000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "An Arts-Based Study of the Dynamics of Expressing Positive Emotions within the Intersubjective Art Making Process", "topics": ["Art Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201403, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190332626.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190332626", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6128", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6128"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190332626.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6128", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190332626.pdf"}, {"id": "132282727", "authors": ["Santos, M\u00e1rio Jo\u00e3o Coutinho dos"], "contributors": ["Hayes III, Samuel L", "Marques, Manuel de Oliveira"], "description": "Doutoramento em Gest\u00e3o IndustrialA disserta\u00e7\u00e3o analisa, te\u00f3rica e empiricamente, a problem\u00e1tica das decis\u00f5es (volunt\u00e1rias) de estrutura de capital da empresa banc\u00e1ria, com o prop\u00f3sito depromover o alargamento do conhecimento sobre o comportamento das empresasquando definem e reajustam a sua estrutura de financiamento estrat\u00e9gico.\r\nPartindo da teoria geral da estrutura de capital, tipicamente associada com asempresas n\u00e3o-financeiras, desenvolve-se um quadro te\u00f3rico de refer\u00eancia que suporta a formula\u00e7\u00e3o das hip\u00f3teses que se submetem a teste emp\u00edrico.Este estudo foi desenvolvido com base na metodologia de survey por entrevista pessoal orientadapor question\u00e1rio estruturado.\r\nA investiga\u00e7\u00e3o dos determinantes das decis\u00f5es de estrutura de capital incidiu sobre apopula\u00e7\u00e3o de os Presidentes (executivos) do Conselho de Administra\u00e7\u00e3o de bancosPortugueses em fun\u00e7\u00f5es no per\u00edodo compreendido entre 1989 e 1998.\r\nOs resultados obtidos sugerem que a tomada de decis\u00e3o de estrutura de capital pelos respons\u00e1veis das equipas de gest\u00e3o dos bancos portugueses, durante o per\u00edodo em an\u00e1lise, \u00e9 consistente com alguns dos determinantes te\u00f3ricos tipicamente associados com a escolha da rela\u00e7\u00e3o capital pr\u00f3prio / endividamento das empresas n\u00e3o-financeiras, uma vez levadas em considera\u00e7\u00e3o as especificidades inerentes \u00e0 suacondi\u00e7\u00e3o de intermedi\u00e1rio financeiro.

Such hypotheses framed the theoretical underpinnings of theempirical inquiry instrument.\r\nTo perform the empirical study of the determinants of such decisions, acomprehensive survey of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of Portuguese banks inoffice during the 1989-1998 period, was undertaken.\r\nThe findings indicate that Portuguese banks\u2019 capital structure decisions are consistent with a number of theoretical propositions typically associated with the debt-equity choice of non-financial firms once we account, among other factors, for theidiosyncrasy of their financial intermediary nature. Specifically, we provide empirical evidence supporting that taxation at the bank level, agency and governance conflictsand asymmetric information considerations are relevant factors influencing capitalstructure decision-making of Portuguese banks during the 1989-1998 time period. These results are consistent with the notion that the design of firm\u2019s financial structuremay\r\nThe dissertation is organized as follows:\r\nChapter 1 introduces and formulates the capital structure problem at the firm level.Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive discussion of the general theory of capitalstructure.

There are still multiple knowledge gaps regarding HBV in APIs, including information on factors associated with HBV infection and immunity in foreign\u2010born APIs. Particularly in Philadelphia, the epidemiological landscape of chronic HBV infection in high\u2010risk API communities remains largely unknown, making it difficult to develop appropriately targeted interventions. Community\u2010based screening and linkage to care can play an important role in improving low HBV diagnosis rates and generating a more complete understanding of HBV infection in high\u2010risk ethnic communities. However, there are no recommended strategies for addressing HBV infection at the community level, which has limited the success of community\u2010based programs throughout the U.S. This project used a mixed\u2010methods approach to: determine the factors associated with HBV infection and protection (immunity) among APIs in Philadelphia who participated in community\u2010based screening; and to understand the processes, challenges and strategies for conducting enhanced community\u2010based screening and linkage to care. The study included quantitative analysis of survey and seroprevalence data from 2,047 foreign\u2010born and 2nd generation APIs residing in Philadelphia; and qualitative analysis of narratives, focus groups and interviews from two sites that conducted enhanced community\u2010based HBV programming. Controlling for all other variables (at p<0.5), infected individuals in the sample tended to be male, between the ages of 18\u201029, disclosed that they had been previously tested for HBV, had a high school diploma or less, and had either a family member with HBV or HCC, or lived with an infected person; protected individuals in the sample tended to be between the ages of 18\u201029 and born in Korea; susceptible individuals tended to be over age 55, with no family history of HBV, no previous HBV test, and born in a country with no (or a limited) national HBV vaccine program. Not controlling for other variables, being born in China was significantly associated with being linked to care. Results of the qualitative analysis revealed that having a diverse community stakeholder committee was important to the success of enhanced community\u2010based HBV programming. Including stakeholders in all planning stages, and offering ongoing opportunities for training and relationship development helped maintain stakeholder engagement. Limited time, funding, HBV knowledge, bi\u2010lingual resources, and a lack of language capable free health clinics served as challenges to HBV screening, vaccination and linkage to care. Service integration, advanced planning, and having an understanding of community needs were identified strategies to improve programmatic outcomes. Identified challenges with data collection included length of the survey instrument, as well as limited staff time and training needs. The results of this project can be used to guide future community\u2010based interventions in Philadelphia and around the U.S., to successfully improve HBV\u2010related screening, vaccination and linkage to care for high\u2010risk and infected API communities.Dr.P.H., Community Health and Prevention -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6304", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028448000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343082000, "depositedDate": 1551277204000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Chronic HBV Infection and Community\u2010Based Services for High\u2010Risk Asians and Pacific Islanders", "topics": ["Public Health"], "types": [], "year": 201504, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190322199.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190322199", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6304", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6304"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322199.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6304", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322199.pdf"}, {"id": "190325411", "authors": ["Awosan, Christiana Ibilola"], "contributors": ["Hardy, Kenneth V."], "description": "The diminishing rates of marriage and proliferation of individuals who are unmarried in the United States have greatly altered the makeup of heterosexual intimate pair bonding in the general population. For Blacks in the United States, these circumstances are more profound. Over the past decades, the precipitous decline in Black marriages and the salient upsurge of never married Blacks have stimulated much theoretical focus but few empirical research studies on Black adults' heterosexual coupling unions have been undertaken (Camp, 2002; Dixon, 2009; Pinderhughes, 2002; Tucker, 2003). In order to fill the empirical gaps regarding heterosexual coupling unions among Blacks, this qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological study explored the experiences of 26 never married Black men and women (ages 25-35) in their attempts to cultivate and maintain intimate romantic relationships. Through in-depth, open-ended individual interview approach, this phenomenological study, guided with the theoretical frameworks of Africana Womanism (Hudson-Weems, 2008) and Symbolic Interactionism (Charon, 2007), sought to capture and understand how participants described and interpreted their intimate romantic coupling experiences and relationships. The findings illustrated that the overwhelming majority of the participants desired to be married or be involved in a long-term secure and intimate romantic relationship. The majority of the participants felt that the initial stage of cultivating romantic relationships began with strong unspoken connection and passion because of their common Black racial identity, background and culture. Furthermore, participants expressed that their racial location and history in society also contributed to the difficulties that they experienced in maintaining an intimate romantic relationship. Participants contextualized their experiences of cultivating and maintaining intimate romantic relationships within social-historical context of the imposition of whiteness, the residual effects of slavery around skin color and emotional alienation between Black men and women; socio-cultural context of the rarity of long-term, positive quality Black marriages and relationships as well as internalized racial stereotypes; and socio-structural context of gender imbalance in educational, income and career achievements. The findings illustrated that as a result of pairing within these socio-historical, socio-cultural and socio-structural contexts, never married heterosexual Black men and women appeared to be coupling within a shame-based racial context. Participants, therefore, described their experienced coupling processes to be difficult and labor intensive. Given these revealing findings, implications for future research, clinical training and practice, and social policy are provided.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6124", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028502000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Never Married Heterosexual Black Male-Female Intimate Romantic Experiences: A Phenomenological Study", "topics": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Couples Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201405, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190325411.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190325411", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6124", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6124"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190325411.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6124", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190325411.pdf"}, {"id": "158324775", "authors": ["Tao, Cheng"], "contributors": ["Schwing, Alexander G."], "description": "This research aims to solve the problem of predicting the long-term sequential movements of\r\nan object in an image given a force vector applied to the object.

Amid many new assessment practices stands a rare, mature program: the Rite of Passage Experience (R.O.P.E.), a year-long assessment of seniors at a small, alternative public high school in Racine, Wisconsin named Walden III: In the Process of Discovery.Empirical evidence of the validity of inferences of achievement formed by R.O.P.E. assessment teams was sought by means of a validation and a case study. Extensive observations, interviews, and document analysis focused on R.O.P.E. assessment events, perceptions of assessors and assessees, and contexts. Particular attention was paid to demonstrations of mastery and portfolios of a sample, partly purposeful and partly randomized, of 11 students.From voluminous data, the following assertions were drawn. (a) Inferences of student achievement arising from R.O.P.E. assessments were substantially valid, based on deep familiarity with seniors' academic and personal accomplishments in 16 areas. (b) R.O.P.E. exhibited extremely strong consequential validity. Direct educational benefits to students included self-initiated learning and focused preparation for their post-secondary goals. Educational and transformative benefits to students actually outweighed R.O.P.E.'s assessment value. R.O.P.E. also enhanced coherence of the school's educational efforts. (c) Only naturally occurring reliability is valuable. Efforts aimed at raising reliability tend to be educationally counterproductive and to compromise validity because they standardize rather than individualize, drawing attention away from students' unique achievements. R.O.P.E. exhibited strong reliability despite an absence of standardizing factors usually assumed necessary to achieve satisfactory levels of reliability. Contrary to psychometric dogma, a claim is made that reliability is neither necessary nor sufficient for validity. (d) Education needs to emphasize personalized and proleptic student assessment, including individualized standards, and to deemphasize standardized test scores. The validity of R.O.P.E.-based inferences was closely related to the extraordinary personalization of the assessment process.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23579", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586088891000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511767000, "depositedDate": 1305268747000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Performance assessment and inferences of achievement.

It recognizes the sensitive relationship between knowing and emotions. The concept was devised by Robert Jerome Starratt in a dissertation entitled, The Individual and the Educated Imagination: An Essay in Curriculum Theory, which was accepted by the Graduate College of the University of Illinois in 1969. Building on the Starratt concepts which were geared for a secondary school curriculum, this study attempts to identify the factors influencing elementary school climates which promote the learning experiences described in the first sentence. Two elementary schools were studied which might be placed at opposite ends of a continuum ranging economically from poor to affluent. The study is concerned with multiple forces affecting the schools over the ten year period, from the filing of the Starratt dissertation to the completion of the present study. The study focused on such broad influences as declining enrollments, desegregation and political forces which are changing the course of education in the United States.The study advances the premise that curriculum theory and program changes are not likely to succeed unless the underlying forces affecting the educational climate are understood and controlled. The study also suggests that one of the best hopes for achieving the kinds of knowing interlaced with feeling is through improvements in the teacher education process. The value of university laboratory schools in this process is carefully explored. Finally, the delicate relationship between available resources, number of positions, change and the conservation of the school's heritage is a primary concern. The study concludes with the presentation of an administrative strategy or guidelines designed to produce the desired learnings.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/65937", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089270000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511945000, "depositedDate": 1458161480000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Sympathetic Rationality in Elementary Schools", "topics": ["Education, Administration"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291759506", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/65937"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/65937", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291771742", "authors": ["Chin, Christine Hui Li"], "contributors": ["David Brown"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "303 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1997.Analysis of the target students' discourse and actions during the group activities and their interview responses revealed differences between the deep and surface learning approaches regarding generative thinking, nature of explanations, asking questions, metacognitive activity, and approach to tasks. Strategies associated with a deep learning approach included generating mental images and analogies, hypothesizing, thought experimenting and predicting possible outcomes, self-explaining and theorizing, invoking personal experiences and prior knowledge and applying them to new situations, asking questions, thinking of specific examples, and looking for coherence by seeking patterns and relating different aspects of the task. When students used a deep approach, they also constantly monitored and self-evaluated the status of their comprehension, self-questioned, self-corrected their errors, attended to contradictory information, considered limitations in their own or others' ideas and critiqued them.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/80204", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089391000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511999000, "depositedDate": 1458162796000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Students' Learning Approaches and Their Understanding of Some Chemical Concepts in Eighth-Grade Science", "topics": ["Education, Educational Psychology"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291771742", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/80204"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/80204", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "369758590", "authors": ["Jabra, Marwa Ben", "Ammar, Adel", "Koubaa, Anis", "Cheikhrouhou, Omar", "Hamam, Habib"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "2120-01-01T00:00:00", "description": "Pilgrimage represents the most important Islamic religious gathering in the world where millions of pilgrims visit the holy places of Makkah and Madinah to perform their rituals.

This has led to a new trend in Artificial Intelligence towards knowledge-intensive methods such as explanation-based learning, qualitative reasoning, theory-driven machine discovery and deep-model expert systems. Knowledge-intensive systems rely on a model of the domain, called a domain theory, to fulfill their tasks. A domain theory consists of an encoding of the knowledge required by the system to draw inferences about situations of interest. The primary shortcomings of a system that relies on a domain theory are twofold: (1) The construction of an adequately complete and correct domain theory to insure a satisfactory level of performance is virtually impossible for most complex real-world domains. (2) The performance of the system is fundamentally limited by the deductive closure of the knowledge initially encoded into its domain theory and consequently the system does not perform well in underspecified or dynamically changing domains.This thesis describes a method called explanation-based theory revision for augmenting and correcting a domain theory. The method consists of detecting failures due to the inadequacies of the domain theory, hypothesizing modifications or additions to the domain theory to eliminate the failures, designing experiments to refute incorrect hypotheses, recalling previous experiences of the system to eliminate inconsistent hypotheses and selecting a best theory from the remaining theories based on aesthetic criteria. Explanation-based theory revision addresses both the problems mentioned above. It corrects and augments inadequate domain theories when failures occur. Furthermore since the deductive closure of the knowledge in the domain theory changes the system learns at the knowledge level. Explanation-based theory revision has been incorporated into a system called COAST. COAST revises qualitative theories of the physical world. COAST has been demonstrated on a number of implemented examples involving the revision of qualitative theories about physical phenomena such as evaporation, osmosis, flow of fluids, dissolving of substances, chemical decomposition of compounds and combustion.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/22579", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586088881000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511763000, "depositedDate": 1356676297000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Explanation-based theory revision: An approach to the problems of incomplete and incorrect theories", "topics": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291718357", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/22579"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/22579", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291793289", "authors": ["Liu, Shuijing"], "contributors": ["Parameswaran, Aditya", "Peng, Jian"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "Prostate cancer diagnosis by biopsy images of human tissue requires experienced trained pathologists and the cost is high. To facilitate prostate cancer diagnosis, we built and trained binary classifiers using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on two datasets: one contains cancerous and healthy biopsy images of prostate tissues (referred as Dataset1), and the other contains biopsy images of tissues with recurred cancer and fully recovered tissues (referred as Dataset2). We extracted patches from biopsy images of human tissues, then built and trained CNN models to classify the patches. We achieved 82% test accuracy on Dataset1 and 63% accuracy on Dataset2.\r\nIn addition, we used ensemble methods to further boost the performance. With predictions of all patches in our datasets, we performed majority voting on the image level, and the accuracy increases by 5% to 10% on the first dataset.

When visualizing the predictions on the second dataset returned by our models, no clear patterns are found that can distinguish the two classes.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/100023", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089591000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512105000, "depositedDate": 1530910429000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "Prostate cancer diagnosis by deep learning", "topics": ["Image Processing", "Machine Learning", "Bioinformatics", "Computer Vision"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291793289", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/100023"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/100023", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "4823729", "authors": ["Girard, Melissa"], "contributors": ["Nelson, Cary", "Nelson, Cary", "Esty, Jed", "Foote, Stephanie", "Somerville, Siobhan B."], "description": "Modernist sentimental poetry is frequently cast as an unfortunate literary and cultural mistake. In an era defined by its novel feats of poetic ambition, modernist sentimental poetry seems inexplicably to regress to the familiar forms and feelings of the nineteenth century. Alongside the modernist proliferation of \u201cnew\u201d poetic forms, modernist sentimental poetry has thus been seen as decidedly \u201cold\u201d: an atavistic remnant of an earlier time and place, out of sync with high modernism\u2019s progressive aesthetic vision. This is a foundational rift, which continues to divide the field of poetic modernism. Poets like T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and H.D. are routinely credited with formal theories of poetic innovation. In stark contrast, the so-called \u201csentimental\u201d poets who comprise this study, figures such as Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sara Teasdale, Genevieve Taggard, and Louise Bogan, have been categorized as conventional lyric poets. Critics have believed, wrongly, that their poetry is coextensive with the aesthetic and political aims of nineteenth-century sentimentality. Through a series of detailed textual and historical readings, \u201cLines of Feeling\u201d demonstrates that this diverse group of modernist women poets reinvented the traditional form of the sentimental lyric in response to modernity. In so doing, they competed directly with the avant-garde to redefine the proper form and function of modernism.LimitedRequested by author.

To address this problem, deep in-memory architecture (DIMA) has been designed to enhance both energy efficiency and throughput over conventional digital architectures by reading multiple bits per cycle and by employing mixed-signal processing in the periphery of the BCA. Due to its mixed-signal nature, DIMA is sensitive to transistor-level spatial process variation and data-dependent non-idealities, which circuit simulation tools fail to capture. In order to have an accurate simulation of DIMA, an emulator is developed based on a model which considers the discharge transistor current equation and normal distribution of spatial threshold voltage variation. The result of the emulator is compared with the measurement of a 65 nm CMOS prototype IC running support vector machine (SVM) on face detection dataset from The Center for Biological & Computational Learning (CBCL) at MIT and predicted the inference accuracy with an error range less than 2%.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104026", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1561103076000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009268000, "depositedDate": 1560574935000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "Pydima: Evaluation on machine learning algorithms on deep in-memory architecture (DIMA)", "topics": ["in-memory", "machine learning", "always-on inference", "mixed-signal", "process variations", "circuit simulation"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/210999275", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/104026"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104026", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "214416451", "authors": [], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "7980-01-01T08:00:00", "description": "Correspondance between Hazel and relatives, and other various documents.

It recognizes the sensitive relationship between knowing and emotions. The concept was devised by Robert Jerome Starratt in a dissertation entitled, The Individual and the Educated Imagination: An Essay in Curriculum Theory, which was accepted by the Graduate College of the University of Illinois in 1969. Building on the Starratt concepts which were geared for a secondary school curriculum, this study attempts to identify the factors influencing elementary school climates which promote the learning experiences described in the first sentence. Two elementary schools were studied which might be placed at opposite ends of a continuum ranging economically from poor to affluent. The study is concerned with multiple forces affecting the schools over the ten year period, from the filing of the Starratt dissertation to the completion of the present study. The study focused on such broad influences as declining enrollments, desegregation and political forces which are changing the course of education in the United States.The study advances the premise that curriculum theory and program changes are not likely to succeed unless the underlying forces affecting the educational climate are understood and controlled. The study also suggests that one of the best hopes for achieving the kinds of knowing interlaced with feeling is through improvements in the teacher education process. The value of university laboratory schools in this process is carefully explored. Finally, the delicate relationship between available resources, number of positions, change and the conservation of the school's heritage is a primary concern.

This systematic analysis, first of its kind in the literature, indicates that out of 15 ECG leads,\r\ndata from the v6, vz, and ii leads are critical to correctly identify myocardial infarction. Second, we\r\nshow that using two independent train-validation-test data splits, namely, record-wise and patient-wise,\r\ndoes not change the finding that the combination of the leads v6, vz, and ii provides the best\r\nclassification results for myocardial infarction, achieving 99.43% classification accuracy on a record-wise\r\nsplit, and 97.83% classification accuracy on a patient-wise split. These two results represent\r\ncardiologist-level performance for myocardial infarction detection after feeding only 10 seconds of raw ECG data into our multi-ECG-channel (v6-vz-ii) neural network model.

Some of the obstacles to cost-effective commercial-scale production have been culture contamination and expensive harvest methods.  A chrysophyte isolated from Berkeley Pit Lake and identified as Chromulina freiburgensis, was found to grow rapidly in a pH 2.5 liquid medium and to amass numerous intracellular lipid bodies.  This research addresses the scarcity of published knowledge on the topic of chrysophyte species as potential lipid sources for biodiesel.  It investigates how growth phase, culture conditions, and harvest timing influence the quantity and composition of lipids produced by this alga.  This research serves as a foundation for optimizing production of lipids that contain the most desirable fatty acid composition for biodiesel.  Six experimental treatments, representing six different combinations of nutrient concentrations, were monitored and sampled during a 52-day growth period, while cellular lipid content was tracked by Nile Red fluorescence measurements.  Lowering medium nitrogen concentration resulted in increased lipid production, which was further increased by lowering phosphorus concentration and supplementing with CO2.  The combination of lowered nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations resulted in the highest proportion of C18:1 (50.1%) in the composition of fatty acid methyl esters from algal lipids, after approximately 22 days of stationary growth.  The alga maintained its growth and favorable fatty acid composition with a modest increase in CO2.  Although C. freiburgensis from Berkeley Pit Lake did not clearly demonstrate a high lipid content, its fatty acid composition is favorable for biodiesel production, and it has additional traits which may prove advantageous.  Its acidic medium provides protection from culture contamination, and could potentially utilize acid mine drainage water.  Fungal-assisted bioflocculation could then provide an economical means of harvest.  This unique microalga is well suited for both cost-saving methods, and it has the potential to serve secondary roles in bioremediation or in CO2 removal from flue gases", "identifiers": ["oai:digitalcommons.mtech.edu:grad_rsch-1210", null], "language": {"code": "en", "id": 9, "name": "English"}, "publisher": "Digital Commons @ Montana Tech", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "1282", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Digital Commons @ Montana Tech", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1562664841000, "metadataUpdated": 1611345609000, "depositedDate": 1558639752000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "GROWTH, LIPID PRODUCTION AND BIODIESEL POTENTIAL OF Chromulina freiburgensis Dofl., AN ACIDOPHILIC CHRYSOPHYTE ISOLATED FROM BERKELEY PIT LAKE", "topics": ["biodiesel", "algae", "chrysophyte", "lipids", "triglycerides", "extremophile", "Biology", "Environmental Chemistry"], "types": [], "year": 2109, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/212814240.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/212814240", "https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/grad_rsch/205", "https://digitalcommons.mtech.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1210&amp;context=grad_rsch"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/212814240.pdf", "oai": "oai:digitalcommons.mtech.edu:grad_rsch-1210", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/212814240.pdf"}, {"id": "190333335", "authors": ["Chiu, Yu En"], "contributors": ["Hartzell, Elizabeth"], "description": "The purpose of this arts-based heuristic inquiry was to explore the transformational process in an art therapy intern's emerging professional identity while working with adults diagnosed with chronic mental illness.

EDs are predominately a problem for girls and women. Approximately 90% of people who develop EDs are female (Harvard Health Publications, 2012). Objectification theory (Frederickson & Roberts, 1997) posits that internalization of sexualized media messages (self-objectification) and social pressures lead to ED behaviors. Not all females exposed to objectifying stimuli experience ED behaviors. This study explored insecurity in family relationships as a risk factor; specifically, whether women who have greater attachment insecurity are more prone to self-objectification and ED-specific attentional bias. Components of Frederickson et al.'s (1998) and Tiggemann & Boundy\u2019s (2008) experimental designs were replicated. This design has shown that (1) self-objectification can be heightened by context, and (2) self-objectification induces feelings of body shame, which promote ED behaviors. To test attachment insecurity as a risk factor in the objectification framework, a repeated measures experimental design was conducted with women (n = 107), between the ages of 18 and 35. This study utilized a repeated measures, experimental design where each participant either viewed an image set reinforcing the thin-ideal or a control image set of products (no people). Participants were assigned to one of four groups using the minimization method (high attachment insecurity and control images; low attachment insecurity and control images; high attachment insecurity and experimental images; low attachment insecurity and experimental images). Groups were balanced on race, type of insecurity (anxious, avoidant, both), and level of insecurity (over a standard deviation above the mean). The study involved deception in that participants were told that the purpose was to understand women\u2019s attitudes towards advertising. Participants took a screening measure online to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria and then were invited to an in-person session. During in-person data-collection sessions, participants filled out outcome-specific, exploratory and deception self-report measures, viewed the experimental or control image set, and took a cognitive processing test with ED-specific stimuli. Using a factorial MANCOVA, the following hypotheses were tested while controlling for self-esteem (SISE) and parental psychological control (PCS-YSR): 1) Exposure to objectifying stimuli will cause higher levels of state self-objectification (TST) and greater attentional bias towards ED-salient stimuli (ED-specific stroop test); and 2) Exposure to objectifying stimuli will cause higher levels of state self-objectification and greater attentional bias towards ED-salient stimuli for the high attachment insecurity (ECR-RS) group. These hypotheses were tested within a sample of racially and ethnically diverse women. Results demonstrated that those in the high attachment insecurity group demonstrated more attentional bias towards ED-specific stimuli regardless of condition.

The emphasis of the work is on teaching effectiveness  which I tie to the specific beliefs of teachers, and to how these beliefs encourage reluctant student motivation and engagement. This study is built upon several rational concepts. First, the classroom teacher can and does have a direct impact on the effectiveness of a learning session. Second, the words and actions of a teacher are only manifestations of a deeper dynamic and are therefore not essential qualities of instruction. The third is that effective practice can be experienced, understood, and communicated. Moustakas's (1990) methodological steps are leveraged to reach a deep understanding of my own teaching experience, to cast these experiences in contrast to the accounts of others in the student intervention research and teaching literature, and to communicate the resulting understanding to the readers of this report. The results of this research include (a) a thorough communication of the nature and qualities of reluctant students and their classrooms, (b) an integrated discussion of the role of teacher within these classrooms, and (c) a discussion of teacher beliefs that encourage teaching effectiveness. These identified beliefs include the notion that teaching relationships are both personal and challenging, dialogue (internal, between students, and between teacher and student) is essential and is itself learning, quality in aims and goals must be a consideration in effective planning and practice, all students have limitless potential, and effective practitioners by nature work to improve their practice on a continuing basis.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/79989", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089390000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511998000, "depositedDate": 1458161671000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Teaching Reluctant Learners", "topics": ["Education, Mathematics"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291771527", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/79989"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/79989", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291790524", "authors": ["Lin, Meng"], "contributors": ["Lazebnik, Svetlana"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "Recent developments on deep learning have enabled generative models to capture distribution of \r\nrelatively complex datasets.

Thus, there is a need for more couple-based psychosocial interventions designed to help couples patients and their partners with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Emotionally Focused Therapy for couples (EFT) is an attachment evidenced based model that has some support for use with couples coping with chronic illness. Prior researchers who evaluated couple-based psychosocial cancer interventions have included primarily white middle class samples and most focused on cognitive behavioral and psycho-educational approaches. Using attachment theory (Bowlby, 1980) and the biopsychoscial approach (Engel, 1977), this one-arm program evaluation study (pre-post test) was designed to examine if an adapted version of a couple\u2019s group therapy treatment, Hold Me Tight (HMT: Johnson, 2009) can help a racially diverse low to middle income sample of couples cope with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in a spouse or in a committed partner. A total of seven couples, six African American and one White/Asian couple (total of n=14 participants) completed this study. The couple support group intervention (HMT) was evaluated at baseline and post-intervention. The following two specific aims were examined: 1) Assess intervention acceptability and feasibility using recruitment and retention rates, participants\u2019 reasons for refusal or dropout, and level of post-intervention participant satisfaction; and 2). Pilot test treatment efficacy by comparing the pre-test and post-test measures for couples who completed the study. A comparison of baseline and post-intervention psychological (BDI II), relationship satisfaction (RDAS), attachment (ECR-S, BARE), and impact of the cancer (IES and FACT-G, version 4.0 for patients only) measures were conducted. Descriptive statistics, paired samples t-tests, and repeated measure ANOVAs were conducted to describe pre-post differences. Despite the slower than anticipated rate of recruitment at the one referring northeastern urban oncology clinic (25 couples were referred over a 13-month recruitment period; 12 volunteered and 7 couples completed the study), findings suggest the intervention is acceptable, although more feasible for patients post-cancer treatment (survivors). According to the repeated measures ANOVA results, there were significant medium to large effects for improved relationship satisfaction (RDAS total) and a decreased traumatic impact of the cancer diagnosis (IES total) for both patients and partners from pre-intervention to post-intervention. The outcome of this one-year pilot feasibility study was evidence of a promising theoretically-based (Attachment in Couples: Hazan & Shaver, 1987) brief couple support intervention for diverse samples of couples coping with cancer, acceptability, feasibility, and pilot data.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6307", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028628000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343083000, "depositedDate": 1551277204000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Couples Coping with Cancer: A Hold Me Tight Pilot Intervention Study", "topics": ["Couples Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201505, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190330718.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190330718", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6307", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6307"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190330718.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6307", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190330718.pdf"}, {"id": "190331224", "authors": ["Cooper, Candice P."], "contributors": ["Watson, Marlene F."], "description": "This qualitative retrospective study examined lived experiences of African American males and females whom witnessed male to female intimate partner violence (IPV) as low-income youth. Race, class, experience of witnessing IPV, and impact on self-identity and development were explored to gain a more in-depth understanding of the collective meaning of these variables to participants. Few studies in the field of couple and family therapy have focused on IPV, particularly in African Americans (Avis, 1992; Bograd, 1999; McDowell & Jeris, 2004). Thus this study endeavored to contribute to the family therapy literature on IPV and African Americans. Ten African American adult males and females from low-income backgrounds were sampled using semi-structured interviews. Developmental-ecological theory was the theoretical framework for this study and data analysis was conducted utilizing a retrospective integrative phenomenological approach (Giorgi, 1997; Moustakas, 1994; van Manen, 1990). Findings revealed the following: loss of safety; feelings of helplessness though some participants tried to protect their mothers/caregivers despite the danger; growing up quickly and loss of childhood; independence; and issues in adolescence (violence in dating relationships, emotional distress and risky behaviors). Further, participants reported that it was very difficult to be a low-income youth due to their exposure to violence, poverty, and other dangerous situations within the community. Consequently, there was a large impact on participants\u2019 self-identity and development. Participants saw themselves as products of their environment, specifically since they not only had to deal with the structural inequities of being low-income but also African American. Remarkably, participants attributed their resiliency and tenacity to negative experiences and believed they were better individuals because of them.Ph.D., Individual, Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6129", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028637000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "A retrospective study on African American experiences of witnessing male to female intimate partner violence (IPV) as low-income youth and the impact on adolescent self-identity and development", "topics": ["Family Therapy", "Couples Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201212, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190331224.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190331224", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6129", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6129"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190331224.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6129", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190331224.pdf"}, {"id": "288869617", "authors": ["Rita, Nicole Oliveira"], "contributors": ["Castelli, Mauro"], "datePublished": "2023-03-13T00:00:00", "description": "Dissertation presented as the partial requirement for obtaining a Master's degree in Information Management, specialization in Knowledge Management and Business IntelligencePredicting the stock market was never seen as an easy task.

SS treatment is also able to reverse cognitive deficits associated with aging or with experimental brain injuries and evaluated in a two-way active avoidance (2wAA) task. The main objective of the present study was to explore the potential of the SS treatment to reverse the complete learning and memory impairment caused by bilateral lesion in the lateral amygdala (LA). The effects of post-training SS, administered after each acquisition session, were evaluated on distributed 2wAA acquisition and 10-day retention in rats with electrolytic bilateral LA lesions. SS effect in acetylcholinestaresase (AchE) activity was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in LA-preserved and Central nuclei (Ce) of the amygdala of LA-damaged rats. Results showed that LA lesion over 40% completely impeded 2wAA acquisition and retention. Post-training SS in the LA-lesioned rats improved conditioning and retention compared with both the lesioned but non-SS treated and the non-lesioned control rats. SS treatment also seemed to induce a decrease in AchE activity in the LA-preserved area of the lesioned rats, but no effects were observed in the Ce. This empirical evidence supports the idea that self-administered rewarding stimulation is able to completely counteract the 2wAA acquisition and retention deficits induced by LA lesion. Cholinergic mechanisms in preserved LA and the contribution of other brain memory-related areas activated by SS could mediate the compensatory effect observedThis research was supported by an I+D (Mineco) grant (PSI2009-07491) and a Generalitat of Catalunya grant (2009SGR", "identifiers": ["oai:dugi-doc:10256/10981", "10.1016/j.bbr.2014.07.050"], "journals": [{"title": null, "identifiers": ["0166-4328", "issn:0166-4328"]}], "publisher": "Elsevier", "relations": ["http://hdl.handle.net/10256/10981", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.07.050"], "repositories": [{"id": "1379", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "DUGiDocs \u2013 Universitat de Girona", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1512310438000, "metadataUpdated": 1560194359000, "depositedDate": 1510617600000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/article", "info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion"], "title": "Rewarding brain stimulation reverses the disruptive effect of amygdala damage on emotional learning", "topics": ["Cervell -- Malalties -- Tractament", "Brain -- Diseases -- Treatment", "Cervell -- Estimulaci\u00f3", "Brain stimulation", "Neurobiologia", "Neurobiology"], "types": [], "year": 2050, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/132557634", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.07.050", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.07.050", "http://hdl.handle.net/10256/10981"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbr.2014.07.050", "oai": "oai:dugi-doc:10256/10981", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291799243", "authors": ["Guan, Junfeng"], "contributors": ["Hassanieh, Haitham"], "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:18:25Z", "description": "Recent years have witnessed much interest in expanding the use of networking signals beyond communication to sensing, localization, robotics, and autonomous systems.  This thesis explores how we can leverage recent advances in 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) technology for imaging in self-driving cars. Specifically, the use of mmWave in 5G has led to the creation of compact phased arrays with hundreds of antenna elements that can be electronically steered. Such phased arrays can expand the use of mmWave beyond vehicular communications and simple ranging sensors to a full-fledged imaging system that enables self-driving cars to see through fog, smog, snow, etc. \n\nUnfortunately, using mmWave signals for imaging in self-driving cars is challenging due to the very low resolution, the presence of fake artifacts resulting from multipath reflections and the absence of portions of the car due to specularity. This thesis presents HawkEye, a system that can enable high resolution mmWave imaging in self-driving cars. HawkEye addresses the above challenges by leveraging recent advances in deep learning known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). HawkEye introduces a GAN architecture that is customized to mmWave imaging and builds a system that can significantly enhance the quality of mmWave images for self-driving cars.U of I OnlyAuthor requested U of Illinois access only (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106385", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089650000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512143000, "depositedDate": 1585631071000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "High resolution millimeter wave imaging for self-driving cars", "topics": ["Autonomous Driving", "Millimeter Wave Imaging Radar", "Generative Adversarial Network"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291799243", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106385"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106385", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291799335", "authors": ["Sanchez-Walker, Noelia"], "contributors": ["Montrul, Silvina A", "Montrul, Silvina A", "Ionin, Tania", "Bowles, Melissa", "Jegerski, Jill", "Foote, Rebecca"], "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:39:04Z", "description": "This study investigated comprehension of complex syntax in Spanish, namely passive and relative clauses, by early English-Spanish bilinguals, also known as heritage language (HL) learners, and by second language (L2) learners. To contribute to current theoretical debates on the role of input and age in L2 and bilingual language acquisition, and to current pedagogical inquires on how instruction can be beneficial for HL learners, this study sought to find out whether age of onset of meaningful exposure (and consequently type of L2/HL input and experience) affected adult L2 learners and heritage speakers\u2019 knowledge of these structures, which are acquired early (by age 3 or 4) but are most frequently used and mastered at a later age during the school-age period. This study also investigated whether language learning experience, for late bilinguals after adolescence as a second language (L2) in a classroom; for early bilinguals, from birth as heritage language (HL) in informal familiar settings, affect their performance in tasks of oral and written modalities. Given that these structures are mastered during the school-age period, this study also focuses on how instruction in Spanish from pre-K to graduate school affect comprehension of these clauses.\n\nRelative clauses are embedded clauses that modify a noun phrase (NP), the head of the main clause, which in this study were either in the subject or in the object position. In Spanish, relative clauses involve a type of wh-movement where a special null wh-word referred to as an operator (Op) in the deep structure moves to the Spec of the CP. When the operator moves, it leaves a trace or a gap within the clause. Although many factors affect processing of relative clauses, it is generally agreed that the linear distance (LD) between the head and the gap accounts for the ease or difficulty processing subject relative and object relative clauses, at least in head-initial languages. The relative clauses in this study were subject and object relative clauses with inanimate NPs and reversible and plausible contexts in which either the subject or the object could perform the action described by the verb in the complementizer phrase (CP). The sentences were designed to control for plausibility to prevent a context bias favoring one interpretation or another. The only way for the learners to determine which NP was the subject or the object in the clause was by processing the inflectional morphology of the verb that agreed with the subject. Only third person singular and plural verb conjugations were used. \n\nIn examples (1) and (2) the linear distance in words between the head and the gap is shorter in the subject relative clause than in the object relative clause.\n\n(1) Subject Relative Clause (SR) \n\nThe submarineSUBJECT that ____ sankVERB the boatsOBJECT.     LD = 1 word\n\n(2) Object Relative Clause (OR) \n\nThe submarineOBJECT that the boatsSUBJECT sankVERB _____.    LD = 4 words\n\nWhile English relatives are constructed with one word order, Spanish relatives can be constructed with two, showing different linear distances between the head and the gap. Relative clauses in examples (3) and (4) have the same word order as English relative clauses.\n\n(3) SR  El submarinoSUBJECT que _____ hundi\u00f3VERB los barcosOBJECT.  LD = 1 word\n\n(4) OR  El submarinoOBJECT que los barcosSUBJECT hundieronVERB _____. LD = 4 words\n\nAnd examples (5) and (6) show the other possible word order for SR, with Verb-Object inversion, and for OR, with Subject-Verb inversion, respectively. The SR in (5) is extremely rare in the input.\n\n(5) SR  El submarinoSUBJECT que los barcosOBJECT _____ hundi\u00f3VERB.  LD = 3 words\n\n(6) OR  El submarinoOBJECT que hundieronVERB _____ los barcosSUBJECT. LD = 2 words\n\nObject relatives OR (OSV) were expected to be harder to comprehend than SR (SVO) based on the linear distance between the head and the gap. Furthermore, the ease of comprehension of relative clauses was expected to vary based on the LD in words in the following manner: SR(SVO) >OR(OVS)>SR(SOV>OR(OSV), where \u2018>\u2019 means \u2018easier than\u2019.\n\nThe other structure tested was passive clauses. Passive clauses included verbal and adjectival passive clauses with the copulas in the imperfect tense era and estaba, respectively. See (7) and (8). Comprehension of verbal passive clauses, as opposed to the comprehension of adjectival passive clauses, was predicted to be more difficult for both groups of leaners. First, there is a canonical construction for the verbal passive clause in the past with the copula in the preterite tense fue, with which learners are more familiar. Second, another passive voice construction, the reflexive passive, also known as morphological passive or se-passive, is more frequent in Spanish. Third, the verbal passive clause with the copula in the imperfect tense in HL and L2 acquisition is not common in oral communication. And, last, the imperfect tense is vulnerable to incomplete acquisition in L2 and HL learners\u2019 grammars. \n\nThis study was designed with truncated passive clauses with actional verbs and irreversible contexts, meaning that the theme could not perform the action stated by the verb. Instead the theme was always the object of, or was in a state resulting from the action stated by the verb.\n\n(7) La comida estaba servida.    Adjectival/ Stative Passive\n\ndinner was (estar.IMPERFECT) served.\n\n\u2018Dinner was served.\u2019\n\n\n(8) La comida era servida.    Verbal/Eventive Passive\n\ndinner was (ser.IMPERFECT) served.\n\n\u2018Dinner was being served.\u2019\n\n\nUnlike adjectival passives, verbal passive clauses trigger a reanalysis of the sentence to organize the thematic roles. To comprehend adjectival/stative passives with participles, learners had to realize that a description of a state or final result followed the copula estar. To comprehend verbal passive clauses, learners had to know that the first noun phrase was not the agent, but the object. The reanalysis is triggered at the past participle in English (Mack, Meltzer-Asscher, Barbieri, & Thompson, 2013). In this dissertation it is assumed that Spanish reanalysis involves the copula. If the copula was ser, the clause was a verbal passive not an adjectival passive. When processing the copula, learners had to integrate the meaning of the imperfect form era, which refers to an ongoing or habitual action in the past. L2 and HL learners are familiar with passive voice structures and they have been shown to be familiar with the canonical passive clause with fue in Spanish. Thus, comprehension of these passive clauses required not only knowledge of its syntax, but also of the complementary distribution of ser and estar. Acquiring the complementary distribution of the copulas is a hard task for L2 learners and HL learners as they need to acquire not only their irregular inflectional morphology but also the contrasts between each copula regarding syntax, semantics and pragmatics, a contrast that is not present in English.\n\n116 participants completed an aural and a written version of a Picture Matching Task created to test comprehension of these clauses. They also completed an aural and written version of a Grammaticality Judgment Task to test basic grammar knowledge needed to comprehend these structures, and their linguistic history was recorded in a bilingual language questionnaire. Their proficiency was measured with a written test (DELE) and an oral narrative coded to calculate the moving average type-token ratio (MATTR), mean length of utterance (MLU) and fluency in words per minute.\n\nResults showed that SR(SVO) and OR(OSV) were both easily comprehended by both groups of learners. The fact that SR(SVO) and OR(OSV) show the same word order as their English counterparts might explain the result. A study with speakers of another L1 with different word order (i.e. Chinese, Korean, Turkish) would be needed to confirm this possibility with more certainty. Contrary to the prediction based on the LD, comprehension of SR(SOV) was low, which is explained by how infrequent they are in the input. OR (OVS) were interpreted as SR (SVO) by L2 and HL learners of lower proficiency. As written DELE proficiency increased so did correct interpretation of OR(OVS) for HL and L2 learners. The prediction based on the LD was not borne out and highlights the importance of extra-linguistic factors in the comprehension of these clauses. Frequency of the structure affects comprehension of relative clauses, and so does written and oral proficiency. \n\nResults for passive clauses showed that L2 and HL learners were more accurate with adjectival passive clauses than with verbal passive clauses. These difficulties in the comprehension of verbal passive clauses show that learners have not yet acquired the full spectrum of copula uses and interpreted era in the verbal passive clause as estaba in an adjectival passive clause, a simpler construction. \n\nBesides comprehension of these structures, this study investigated how age of meaningful exposure to Spanish, modality of task, and instruction in the HL/L2 language from pre-K to graduate school affected comprehension of these clauses.\n\nResults from the comprehension of passive and relative clauses show age of meaningful exposure to Spanish as a robust predictor of successful language acquisition. HL learners were significantly more accurate than L2 learners in the comprehension of passive clauses and significantly more accurate in the comprehension of the object relative clause OR-OVS. This indicates that early exposure to Spanish confers HL learners an advantage in the comprehension of clauses with complex syntax.\n\nRegarding task modality, L2 and HL learners\u2019 linguistic experience influences their abilities with language tasks because each experience emphasizes different language skills (Bowles, 2011b; Montrul, 2016). L2 learners\u2019 meaningful exposure to Spanish in the classroom helps them develop metalinguistic or explicit knowledge of the language, and hence they tend to perform well in tasks that target metalinguistic knowledge. HL learners also have limited meaningful exposure to the language, but their exposure is mostly aural in informal settings with family and community. They do not have significant experience writing or reading the HL, and, typically do not have metalinguistic knowledge of the HL (Montrul, 2008b, 2016). Because their experience with the language is mostly aural, they tend to perform better in aural tasks that tap on implicit knowledge, or on intuitive information (Bowles, 2011a; Montrul, Foote, & Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, 2008a; Montrul & Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, 2011). Results showed that modality affected comprehension of both groups of learners but with different clauses. L2 learners performed significantly better in the written modality with relative clauses, while HL learners performed significantly better in the aural modality with passive clauses. \n\nThis thesis also focused on how instruction interacted with age of meaningful exposure in the acquisition of complex syntax. Results showed that instruction significantly accounted for L2 learners\u2019 comprehension of passive clauses, but not for comprehension of relative clauses. Although instruction did not account for HL learners\u2019 comprehension of any of the clauses, an important finding of this dissertation is that instruction in Spanish could be more fruitful for HL learners if it starts in elementary school. Early instruction and language use at an early age conferred advantages to HL learners in the comprehension of verbal passive clauses with era. The data suggested that parental Spanish use with learners (input), combined with learners\u2019 Spanish language use with parents (output), and early frequent Spanish use (between the ages of 6 and 10) positively influenced comprehension of verbal passive clauses with era. Moreover, the data suggested that early bilingual education could be a contributing factor too.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106477", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089650000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512143000, "depositedDate": 1585631338000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Comprehension of Spanish relative and passive clauses by early bilinguals and second language learners", "topics": ["Heritage Language, Early bilingual, bilingualism, second language acquisition, Complex clauses, relative clauses, passive clauses, task modality, second language instruction, proficiency, oral proficiency, language comprehension"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291799335", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106477"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106477", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291799348", "authors": ["You, Sixian"], "contributors": ["Boppart, Stephen A", "Boppart, Stephen A", "Sinha, Saurabh", "Nelson, Erik R", "Popescu, Gabriel"], "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:39:04Z", "description": "The preparation, staining, visualization and interpretation of histological images of tissue is well accepted as the gold standard process for the diagnosis of disease. These methods have a long history of development, and are used ubiquitously in pathology, despite being highly time- and labor-intensive. Label-free nonlinear optical microscopy, which produces high-resolution images with rich functional and structural information based on intrinsic molecular contrast, has demonstrated significant potential to overcome these problems by leveraging its nonperturbative nature and intrinsic molecular profiling capability. Despite these advantages, conventional methods for label-free multiphoton imaging are burdened by limited contrast and efficiency of individual modalities as well as complex laser systems, which hinders this technology from wider application in biomedicine.\nThis thesis developed a fiber-based single-excitation multiphoton microscope capable of real-time, structural and functional imaging of living tissue which will be used to identify potential biomarkers for human breast cancer and facilitate automated histopathology. We introduce single-shot label-free autofluorescence-multiharmonic (SLAM) microscopy, a single-excitation source nonlinear imaging platform that uses a custom-designed excitation window at 1110\u2009nm and shaped ultrafast pulses at 10\u2009MHz to enable fast (2-orders-of-magnitude improvement), single-shot, and efficient acquisition of autofluorescence (FAD and NADH) and second/third harmonic generation from a wide array of cellular and extracellular components (e.g., tumor cells, immune cells, vesicles, and vessels) in living tissue. This innovation achieves better, faster, and richer visualization of living systems and is an enabling advance for stain-free slide-free in vivo histopathology. \nEncouraged by its versatility and efficiency in visualizing biological tissue, SLAM microscopy is further used for label-free in situ characterization of extracellular vesicles, which has been an important but challenging research topic due to their small size and largely unknown and heterogenous cargo. The in situ metabolic profiling capacity of the proposed method, together with the finding of increasing NAD(P)H-rich EV subpopulations in breast cancer, has the potential for empowering applications in basic science and enhancing our understanding of the active metabolic roles that EVs play in cancer progression.\nApplication to label-free histopathology and EV characterizations demonstrate the unique advantage of SLAM microscopy with its single-band, single-shot, structural-metabolic profiling capacity. However, to take full advantage of the rich, multi-dimensional information provided by these technologies, reproducible and reliable computational tools that could facilitate the diagnosis are needed. Therefore, a deep-learning-based framework was developed to recognize cancer versus normal human breast tissue from real-time label-free virtual histology images. These results demonstrate that through the combination of real-time virtual histopathology and a deep-learning framework, accurate real-time diagnosis could be achieved in point-of-procedure clinical applications. \nCombining the novelties and advantages of SLAM microscopy, the distinct signatures of cancer EVs, and the development of a classification algorithm, the work presented in this thesis paves way for stain-free slide-free real-time molecular histopathology and is expected to broadly impact the biosciences and clinical medicine.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106490", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089650000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512143000, "depositedDate": 1585631405000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Multiphoton microscopy for stain-free slide-free histopathology", "topics": ["Multiphoton microscopy, label-free, histopathology, intravital imaging, nonlinear optical imaging, cancer imaging"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291799348", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106490"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106490", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291799300", "authors": ["Xu, Li"], "contributors": ["Kwan, Mei-Po", "Kwan, Mei-Po", "McLafferty, Sara", "Li, Bo", "Cidell, Julie"], "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:39:04Z", "description": "In the past decade or so, advances in positioning technologies and the prevalence of smart personal devices for capturing individual movement have given rise to a wide range of studies, including transportation, public health, tourism, and social network services. With the fast-growing volume of and interest in spatio-temporal mobility data, there is also an increasing need for new methods of analyzing this kind of data. Particularly, considerable effort has been made to characterize human activity-travel patterns from the spatio-temporal mobility data. However, knowledge discovery from the large-scale human mobility data remains a challenging task due to its complex spatio-temporal variations. Most traditional statistical and machine learning techniques are powerful for prediction tasks but are not tailored to characterize the dynamical spatio-temporal correlations in the human mobility data. This dissertation offers several methodological and practical contributions to the field through developing a set of novel methods and validation with real-world use cases. First, a locally adaptive space-time kernel approach is proposed to model the non-emergency municipal services demand in Chicago. Second, this work develops novel sequential similarity measures for analyzing human activity-travel patterns and Bayesian networks models with specially designed topology to predict the forthcoming activity at the individual level. Last, a deep convolutional LSTM networks model is proposed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in an integrated way to predict real-time taxi demand. All proposed models are proven to be more effective or robust in various real-world experiments as compared to traditional statistical or machine learning algorithms but are not limited to these use cases. The methods contribute to any point demand modeling, regional demand modeling, and sequential trajectory learning problems for spatio-temporal data.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106442", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089650000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512143000, "depositedDate": 1585631274000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Advanced space-time integration for knowledge discovery in human mobility studies", "topics": ["Space-time modeling", "Mobility", "Space-time kernel", "Sequential pattern mining", "Bayesian networks", "Demand modeling", "Deep learning", "LSTM"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291799300", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106442"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106442", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "328785800", "authors": ["Dey, Jishnu"], "contributors": ["Zhai, ChengXiang"], "datePublished": "2022-08-27T00:51:40", "description": "Online Forums provide a useful way to engage in discussions about a wide variety of topics, as well as gather custom information for which an exact source may not be available, using a combination of knowledge and human interpretation. Usually forums have categories which cater to a particular topic of interest, allowing information seekers and topic experts to meet. It is thus imperative to organize forum data into an organized structure. In this work we look at methods for categorizing forum posts into appropriate categories, where the number of such categories is large. We compare several baseline methods with state-of-the-art deep learning methods and analyze their performance. We observe that given the highly keyword-centric nature of our data, deep learning methods only slightly outperform baseline methods. Following this, we perform topic modeling on the forum data to find latent topics which creates a hierarchy across forum categories and clusters similar categories. In this process we observe that some of the recent approaches in topic modeling that utilize word embeddings lead to better topics. Finally, we use this hierarchy to perform hierarchical classification of the forum posts to allow better management of the classification task and analyze the benefits of this method.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108348", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1599185973000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571495000, "depositedDate": 1598485937000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Topic mining and categorization in online discussion forums", "topics": ["discussion forums", "topic modeling", "text categorization", "hierarchical categorization"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/328785800", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/108348"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108348", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "33101827", "authors": ["Gonz\u00e1lez S\u00e1nchez, Ignacio"], "contributors": ["Lamo de Espinosa, Emilio", "Serrano Ma\u00edllo, Alfonso"], "datePublished": "2022-06-23T00:00:00", "description": "En esta tesis se presenta un estudio del sistema penal espa\u00f1ol desde 1975 a 2008, con especial atenci\u00f3n al marcado incremento de presos que ha sufrido Espa\u00f1a en una \u00e9poca de ligera reducci\u00f3n de la delincuencia. As\u00ed, se constata, en primer lugar, la ausencia de estudios sociol\u00f3gicos espa\u00f1oles que hayan abordado esta cuesti\u00f3n. En segundo lugar, se muestran las limitaciones de la explicaci\u00f3n aceptada hasta el momento, y que proviene del Derecho. \u00c9sta consiste en ubicar la ra\u00edz de los cambios en la introducci\u00f3n del C\u00f3digo Penal de 1995. En esta tesis se muestra la insuficiencia de esa aproximaci\u00f3n y se aboga por una genuinamente sociol\u00f3gica, que adopte una visi\u00f3n te\u00f3rica y emp\u00edrica m\u00e1s amplia, analizando el castigo como una instituci\u00f3n social.A partir de la tesis de la penalidad neoliberal se procede a un estudio de caso, el cual analiza la evoluci\u00f3n y las caracter\u00edsticas del sistema penal, con especial atenci\u00f3n a la poblaci\u00f3n penitenciaria. Para comprender mejor los presupuestos culturales y la realidad social en la que se desarrolla, se realiza una aproximaci\u00f3n relacional junto con otras instituciones como la pol\u00edtica social y el mercado laboral. As\u00ed, a trav\u00e9s de una descripci\u00f3n emp\u00edrica de las tres esferas, se pretende captar mejor el funcionamiento del sistema penal y los puntos de influencia rec\u00edproca, as\u00ed como superar algunas de las limitaciones de esta teor\u00eda que han sido se\u00f1aladas en la literatura. En concreto, se hace referencia a unos or\u00edgenes hist\u00f3ricos compartidos, un paralelismo institucional y una l\u00f3gica compartida que las transforma.Con base en la evoluci\u00f3n de los datos oficiales, de la legislaci\u00f3n y del an\u00e1lisis de pol\u00edticas concretas, se subraya el papel que tiene determinada comprensi\u00f3n de lo social en la configuraci\u00f3n y el funcionamiento del sistema penal. As\u00ed, aspectos como una antropolog\u00eda economicista, un mayor individualismo, que conlleva una contractualizaci\u00f3n y moralizaci\u00f3n de las relaciones, o las misiones del Estado vistas como leg\u00edtimas permiten una comprensi\u00f3n m\u00e1s rica del incremento de presos o del endurecimiento legislativo. Tal aproximaci\u00f3n facilita, adem\u00e1s, identificar la influencia del sistema penal en otras \u00e1reas de la sociedad, en determinadas concepciones culturales y en el sistema de estratificaci\u00f3n y categorizaci\u00f3n social.Como complemento a la hip\u00f3tesis principal, se comprueban dos hip\u00f3tesis complementarias para los pa\u00edses europeos. Por un lado, se analiza el escaso papel e influencia que han tenido los think tanks espa\u00f1oles en el desarrollo de la penalidad espa\u00f1ola en las \u00faltimas tres d\u00e9cadas. Por otro lado, se analiza la penalizaci\u00f3n de las personas migrantes, tanto en su v\u00eda dura, mediante la c\u00e1rcel, como en la blanda, mediante los controles racistas de identidad por parte de la polic\u00eda. Finalmente se explica su sobrepenalizaci\u00f3n por su posici\u00f3n en el mercado laboral y en las pol\u00edticas sociales, reforzando la hip\u00f3tesis principal de la importancia de un sector cada vez mayor de personas en situaci\u00f3n precaria y de vulerabilidad.Por \u00faltimo, y tras discutir algunas conclusiones te\u00f3ricas y emp\u00edricas de la tesis, se ha a\u00f1adido un ep\u00edlogo que hace referencia a los desarrollos penales desde que comenzase la crisis econ\u00f3mica. Para ello se aplica el marco te\u00f3rico a un objeto no previsto, las manifestaciones y su control policial. Con ello se pretende ver la utilidad de la explicaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la poblaci\u00f3n carcelaria, y pretende ampliar ligeramente el alcance del marco al incluir a las clases medias, las mujeres o la sanci\u00f3n v\u00eda administrativa..", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ucm.es:27930", null], "publisher": "'Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)'", "relations": ["https://eprints.ucm.es/27930/"], "repositories": [{"id": "417", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "EPrints Complutense", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1462561456000, "metadataUpdated": 1608328694000, "depositedDate": 1498172400000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis", "PeerReviewed"], "title": "La penalidad neoliberal: aumento de presos y reconfiguraci\u00f3n del Estado en Espa\u00f1a (1975-2008)", "topics": ["Derecho penal"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33101827.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/33101827", "https://eprints.ucm.es/27930/1/T35622.pdf", "https://eprints.ucm.es/27930/"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/33101827.pdf", "oai": "oai:www.ucm.es:27930", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/33101827.pdf"}, {"id": "286808972", "authors": ["BERTELLI, ELENA"], "contributors": ["Caramella, Davide", "Serni, Sergio"], "datePublished": "2022-12-16T00:00:00", "description": "My PhD project araises from the major change that medicine and healthcare are experiencing in the last decades, moving from reactive to proactive approaches by providing Predictive, Preventive and Personalised medical solutions for the individual patients.\nThe aim of this PhD project was to explore the role of radiomics and radiogenomics in lung and prostate cancers.

Neuroscientists and sleep experts work every day to understand how and what makes sleep more effective in its physical and mental recovery action. Among the most adopted techniques, the standard for the measurement of vital parameters on sleeping subjects is certainly Polysomnography. It is a method that involves many sensors and a laboratory environment, factors that introduce inconveniences that could negatively influence the sleep of the individual himself.\nIn this thesis we will base the experimentation on signals obtained through Ballistocardiography, a portable and less intrusive technique that deduces the heartbeat and respiratory acts based on the accelerations of the body lying on the bed due to forces imparted by the heart to the mass of blood that is pumped to the peripheral body systems.\nIn order to solve the problem of the parametric complexity of explicit analytical models of sleep quality in terms of \"sleep architecture\", in this work we propose a Deep Learning architecture based on multiple levels of Stigmergic Perceptrons. This approach describes a soft classification technique on time series with respect to a collection of archetypes, each representing a different behavioral class.\nFinally, the Deep Learning architecture is integrated with recurrent Long Short-Term Memory networks, known in literature for the classification of time series, above all for their ability to solve the problem of long-term dependencies over time. This technology is appropriate in order to establish a classifier able to recognize the level of quality of sleep declared by the subjects of the measurements and confirmed by a result obtained through the application of quantitative heuristics.\nKeywords: Deep Learning, Sleep Quality, Ballistocardiography, Stigmergic Perceptron, LSTM network\n[Italian]\nSono molto noti gli effetti negativi dovuti ad un sonno non adeguato in esseri umani di qualiasi et\u00e0.

Si tratta di un metodo che prevede molti sensori e un ambiente di laboratorio, fattori che introducono scomodit\u00e0 che potrebbero influenzare negativamente il sonno dell'individuo stesso.\nIn questa tesi baseremo la sperimentazione su segnali ottenuti tramite Ballistocardiografia, una tecnica portabile e meno intrusiva che deduce il battito cardiaco e gli atti respiratori in base alle accelerazioni del corpo giacente sul letto dovute a forze impartite dal cuore alla massa di sangue che viene pompata ai sistemi periferici del corpo.\nAl fine di risolvere il problema della complessit\u00e0 parametrica dei modelli analitici espliciti della qualit\u00e0 del sonno in termini di \"architettura del sonno\", in questo lavoro si propone una architettura di Apprendimento Profondo basata su pi\u00f9 livelli di Percettroni Stigmergici.

We are currently\r\nwitnessing an urgent concern with the learning and skills developed by young people during\r\ntheir school life, in a perspective of high demand that also participates in the high level of\r\nexigency of the technological, social and even environmental challenges. In order to respond\r\nfully to this new paradigm, new approaches and new models are required, from a\r\ncollaborative and non-individual perspective, based on research, analysis and strategic\r\naction. This research aimed to analyse the impact of a process of co-training, carried out in\r\na private school, with 15 teachers from the 2nd and 3rd cycles of ensino b\u00e1sico and upper\r\nsecondary education, with the purpose of researching, reflecting and searching for strategies\r\nthat promote the educational success of students. Based on a joint selection of the themes to\r\nbe addressed due to their importance as factors of retraction for the evolution of the students,\r\nthree work sessions were carried out in different groups. They culminated in a co-training\r\nseminar, during which the themes were addressed and clear-cut strategies for action were\r\ndiscussed.

Such data include structured National Bridge Inventory (NBI) and National Bridge Elements (NBE) data, structured traffic and weather data, and unstructured textual bridge inspection reports. However, despite the availability of the data, existing data-driven prediction methods mostly learn from abstract inventory data (e.g., the NBI data which describe bridge conditions by condition ratings) from a single source \u2013 missing the opportunity of leveraging the wealth of unstructured textual inspection reports and the diverseness of the multi-source data for enhanced deterioration prediction. To capitalize on this opportunity, a novel bridge data analytics framework is proposed. The proposed framework is composed of six primary components: (1) a bridge deterioration knowledge ontology for facilitating semantic information and relation extraction from textual bridge inspection reports based on content and domain-specific meaning; (2) a semi-supervised machine learning-based semantic information extraction method for extracting information entities that describe bridge conditions and maintenance actions from the reports; (3) a supervised machine learning-based semantic relation extraction method for extracting dependency relations from the reports to link the extracted, yet isolated, information entities into concepts and to represent the semantically-low concepts in a semantically-rich structured way; (4) an unsupervised machine learning-based data linking method for linking the data records that are extracted from the reports and refer to the same entity; (5) a hybrid data fusion method for fusing the linked data records into a unified representation and for, subsequently, integrating the fused data with the other types of structured data (i.e., NBI and NBE data, as well as traffic and weather data); and (6) a data-driven, deep learning-based bridge deterioration prediction method for learning from the integrated bridge data to predict the condition ratings of the primary bridge components and to predict the quantities of specific bridge element-level deficiencies. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated in predicting the deterioration of the state-owned bridges in Washington. It achieved a macro-precision and macro-recall of 89.9% and 85.8% when predicting the future condition ratings of the primary bridge components (i.e., decks, superstructures, and substructures), and achieved a root mean square error, coefficient of variation, and coefficient of determination of 1.3, 27.6%, and 0.89, respectively, when predicting the future quantities of specific bridge element-level deficiencies. The experimental results demonstrated the promise of the proposed framework.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106431", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089650000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512143000, "depositedDate": 1585631004000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Machine learning-based analytics of structured and unstructured data for enhanced bridge deterioration prediction", "topics": ["Bridge deterioration prediction", "Data analytics", "Machine learning", "Natural language processing", "Ontology", "Information extraction", "Dependency parsing", "Data linking", "Data fusion"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291799289", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106431"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106431", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "328785733", "authors": ["Qian, Yanli"], "contributors": ["Hwu, Wen-Mei"], "datePublished": "2022-08-27T00:51:40", "description": "With the rapid growth of deep learning models and higher expectations for their accuracy and throughput in real-world applications, the demand for pro\ufb01ling and characterizing model inference on di\ufb00erent hardware/software stacks is signi\ufb01cantly increased.

However, Deep Learning methods depend on large quantities of data with millions of annotated instances. And while well-formed academic datasets have helped advance supervised learning research, in the real-word we are daily deluged by massive amounts of unstructured data, that remain unusable for current supervised learning approaches, as only a small portion is either labeled, cleaned or structured. \n\nIn order for a machine learning model to be effective, volume is not the only data dimension that is necessary. Quality is equally important and has proven to be a critical factor for the success of industrial applications of machine learning. According to IBM, poor data quality can cost more than 3 trillion US dollars per year for the US market alone. Inspired by the need for advanced methods that can efficiently address such bottlenecks, we develop machine learning techniques can be leveraged to improve upon data quality in both data-related dimensions: input and output space. \n\nHaving a set of labeled examples that can capture the task characteristics is one of the most important prerequisites for successfully applying machine learning. As such, we first focus on minimizing the annotation effort for any arbitrary user-defined task by exploring active learning methods. We show that the best performing active learning strategy depends on the task at-hand and we propose a combination of active learners, maximizing annotation performance early in the process. We demonstrate the viability of the approach on several relation extraction tasks. \n\nNext, we observe that even though our method can be used to speed up the collection of labeled training data, the rest will remain unlabeled and thus unexploited. Semi-supervised learning methods proposed in the literature can utilize additional unlabeled data, however, are typically compared on computer vision datasets such as CIFAR10. Here, we perform a systematic exploration of several semi-supervised methods for three sequence labeling tasks and two classification tasks. \n\nAdditionally, most methods have assumptions that are less suitable to realistic scenarios. For example, proposed methods in the recent literature treat all unlabeled examples equally. Yet, in many cases we would like to sort out examples that might be less useful or confusing, particularly in noisy settings where examples with low training loss or high confidence are more likely to be clean examples. In addition, most methods assume that the unlabeled data can be classified into the same classes as the labeled data. This does not take into consideration the very possible scenario of out-of-class instances. For example, our classifier may be distinguishing cats from dogs, but the unlabeled examples may contain additional classes, such as shells, butterflies, etc. To this end, we design methods to mitigate these issues, with a re-weighting mechanism that can be incorporated to any consistency-based regularizer. \n\nBoth active and semi-supervised learning methods aim to reduce labeling efforts by either automatically expanding the training set or selecting the most informative examples for human annotation. However, bootstrapping approaches often result in negative effects on NLP tasks due to the addition of falsely labeled instances. We address the challenge of producing good quality proxy labels, by leveraging the continuously growing stream of human annotations. We introduce a calibration of semi-supervised active learning where the confidence of the classifier is weighted by an auxiliary neural model that remove incorrectly labeled instances and dynamically adjusts the number of proxy labels included in each iteration. Experimental results show that our strategy outperforms baselines that combine traditional active learning with self-training. \n\nWe have explored various ways on how to improve the output space of examples. But the input representation is also equally important. Particularly for social media, (the most abundant source of raw data nowadays) informal writing can cause several bottlenecks. For example, most Information Extraction (IE) tools rely on accurate understanding of text and struggle with the noisy and informal nature of social media due to high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word rates. In this work, we design a social media text normalization hybrid word-character attention-based encoder-decoder model that can serve as a pre-processing step for any off-the-shelf NLP tool to adapt to social media noisy text. Our model surpasses baseline neural models designed for text normalization and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art related work. \n\nAlthough we evaluate on NLP tasks, all methods developed are fairly general and can be applied to other supervised machine learning tasks in need of techniques that create meaningful data representations and simultaneously reduce the burden and cost of human annotations.U of I OnlyAuthor requested U of Illinois access only (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106375", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1583963570000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571445000, "depositedDate": 1583187518000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Data quality in the deep learning era: Active semi-supervised learning and text normalization for natural language understanding", "topics": ["deep learning", "machine learning", "active learning", "semi-supervised learning", "text normalization", "lexical normalizartion", "sequence to sequence", "relation extraction", "neural networks", "natural language processing", "data quality", "self-paced learning", "calibration"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/287624966", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106375"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106375", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "334979927", "authors": ["Tang, Jingning"], "contributors": ["Hwu, Wen-Mei"], "datePublished": "2022-10-07T22:44:53", "description": "As deep learning has been adopted in various domains, the inference process is of growing importance to ensure the deployment across multiple computing platforms.

A sub-category of artificial intelligence is the deep learning. By freeing up the analysis process from pre-processing techniques based on a priori knowledge of the human operator, deep learning allows the automatic extraction of salient information from \"raw data\" by using a series of levels of representation. This makes it a sector of particular interest for the research world, as consequence of the possibility to identify new information characterizing the data, but at the same time also for the industry world thanks to the ability of analyzing large amounts of data increasingly available and accessible.\nIn few years these methods have revolutionized the computer vision field, thanks also to a class of algorithms that has shown remarkable performance in the analysis of the images, i.e. the convolutional neural networks. The use of these tools has been widely used, not only in the field of natural image analysis, but also in the field of medical imaging for the extraction and quantification of clinical information. In this context, one of the most critical operations, that is carried out within the analysis of medical images, is represented by the segmentation, i.e. the process that leads to semantically separate different structures within an image. This operation can be exploited by us- ing different methods, as there is not a universal algorithm to perform segmentation in medical images. The choice of the best strategy will depend on the image modality, the anatomical region that is going to be considered and from what is defined the clinical task. Given the high variability of competing factors for the choice of the algorithm to be used, in clinical practice manual segmentation strategies or semi-automatic approaches are so used, which however are resolved in time consuming processes and often prone to errors, due to the high dependence on the operator and his degree of experience.\nConvolutional neural networks allow in this sense to overcome these limits, providing a general and robust method to perform multimodal segmentation operations.\nIn this doctoral thesis, a series of approaches have been developed, based on the use of convolutional neural networks, for the analysis of medical images. In particular, three different types of acquisition were treated, such as computed tomography (CT) acquisitions, with and without contrast medium, magnetic resonance images and mammograms. The cardiac district is considered the area of interest for both CT and magnetic resonance. The CT scans were acquired for the visualization of anatomical and structural information, whilst the magnetic resonance images for functional information studies.

During this period, the candidate took part in a consulting project aimed at using Image Analytics tools for the proper management of sensitive data which are usually processed in insurance companies\u2019 business processes, in order to be compliant with the GDPR European regulation. In this respect, the need has emerged for the implementation of an Object Detection algorithm, also aimed to remove license plates, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN), and persons from images used for insurance purposes, by relying on the supervised learning of deep neural networks. The technological part was realized using the TensorFlow framework, which allowed to implement a customized RetinaNet model in line with the anonymization task requirements that were specifically sought by the project client. In addition, the work carried out during the project provided the basis for further context analysis. The object of this additional survey concerns the possible ways of leveraging the most recent artificial intelligence tools in insurance business processes, in order to support a digital transformation strategy focused on value deriving from meaningful interpretation and management of data. The results which were obtained from the literature review show how the implementation of machine learning-based and deep learning-based tools allow insurance companies to improve their data-driven processes, unlocking value from the analysis of both structured and unstructured data (e.g., images). The benefits of this approach are expected to be measured in the medium/long run, in terms of positive impact on the customer satisfaction key performance indicators in the insurance domain", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04052019-150458", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1558627343000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262041000, "depositedDate": 1558306800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Leveraging Deep Learning for Automated Image Anonymization in the Insurance Domain", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'ENERGIA, DEI SISTEMI, DEL TERRITORIO E DELLE COSTRUZIONI"], "types": [], "year": 2089, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/200255874", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04052019-150458/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04052019-150458", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "160012002", "authors": ["CIAMPI, LUCA"], "contributors": ["Gennaro, Claudio"], "datePublished": "2088-05-07T00:00:00", "description": "The counting problem is the estimation of the number of objects instances in still images or video frames. It involves various domains, for instance, counting cells or bacteria from microscopic images, estimate the number of people in a crowd scene or counting animals in ecological surveys with the intention of monitoring the population of a certain region. In this thesis work, we deal with the specific problem of counting vehicles in a car park, using frames captured by various different cameras.\nIn principle, the key idea behind objects counting is very simple: density times area. However, objects are not regular across the scene. They cluster in certain regions and are spread out in others. Another factor of complexity is represented by perspective distortions created by different camera viewpoints in various scenes, resulting in large variability of scales of objects. Others challenges points to be considered are inter-object occlusions, high similarity of appearance between objects and background elements, different illumination, and low image quality.\nObjects counting has been tackled as a computer vision problem using many techniques: almost all state-of-the-art approaches make an extensive use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this work, as a first step, we have examined and tested some of these existing CNNs: Multi-column CNN, Hydra CNN, CrowdNet, YOLO9000, mAlexNet and Mask R-CNN}.\nTests are performed using Counting CNRPark-EXT Dataset, a new dataset specifically created in this thesis work for the counting task, that extends the existing CNRPark-EXT Dataset, a collection of images from the parking lots in the campus of the National Research Council (CNR) in Pisa. Then, as a second step, a fine tuning of the best solutions previously identified is performed.\nWe finally show how the results obtained using these fine-tuned networks outperform all the others and how a real car counting system could be implemented, evaluating the number of vehicles and the car park occupancy status from a camera video stream", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-03142018-174808", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1533239613000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262012000, "depositedDate": 1532473200000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Designing and Testing a Deep Learning Based System for Counting Vehicles with Cameras", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'INFORMAZIONE"], "types": [], "year": 2088, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/160012002", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-03142018-174808/", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-03142018-174808/", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-03142018-174808/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-03142018-174808", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "328847674", "authors": ["MASCANDOLA, CLAUDIA"], "contributors": ["Albarello, Dario"], "datePublished": "2023-05-15T00:00:00", "description": "The characterization of seismic site response represents one of the most important issues of seismic hazard assessment and risk mitigation strategies (e.g., microzonation studies). This is particularly important for regions that are characterized by widespread sedimentary cover, with soft soil deposits that overlie rock or rock-like (i.e., stiff soil) formations. The Po Plain sedimentary basin in northern Italy represents a particular case study, which is investigated here.\nIn this thesis, a new seismo-stratigraphic model of the Po Plain sedimentary basin is provided together with a new long-period (> 1 s) site response modelling on the regional scale. Finally, probabilistic seismic hazard assessments (PSHA) are provided with the aim to evaluate the impact of the computed site amplifications on the Po Plain seismic hazard. This research includes two main innovative features: (1) the large-scale application of studies usually performed on the urban-scale; (2) the complex case study in terms of soil amplification, wave propagation and geophysical interpretation.\nIn the first part of this dissertation, the bedrock issue has been addressed. In earthquake engineering, the so-called \u2018engineering bedrock\u2019 is regarded as a stiff material (i.e., rock or rock-like geological formation) that is characterized by a shear-wave velocity greater than a target value (e.g., 800 m/s in the current Italian and European seismic codes). In the case of deep basins, the identification of the engineering bedrock is problematic, as it can lie well below the penetration depth of most common prospecting methods (i.e., a few tens of meters). Moreover, the depth of the engineering bedrock might not represent an effective proxy of the sedimentary thickness responsible for site amplification. Indeed, the deep seismic impedance contrasts may influence the ground motion amplification at the medium and long periods, causing the resonance of vertically travelling shear-waves at specific frequencies. The Po Plain sedimentary basin is one of the deepest and widest worldwide, and presents such problems. The aim of this work is to estimate the sedimentary thickness responsible for ground-motion amplification at medium and long periods. To this end, passive seismic prospecting methods based on ambient-vibration measurements using single-station and array configurations are considered to map the \u2018seismic bedrock\u2019 depth. This corresponds to a marked seismic impedance contrast where the shear-wave velocity approaches, or exceeds, 800 m/s. In the latter case, seismic and engineering bedrocks coincide.\nThe second part of this thesis regards the modelling of ground response at long periods, exploiting the seismic bedrock deep geometry retrieved in the first part. To address this task, a regional shear-wave velocity model of soft sediments above the seismic bedrock is provided through the interpolation of several S-wave velocity profiles obtained from 1-D joint inversion of H/V and array data. To compute the soil amplification functions, the velocity model is discretized into a grid. For each grid node, a 1-D soil model is defined, and a numerical ground response analysis is carried out. The soil model is verified at those sites with borehole seismic stations, where recordings of the same earthquake are available both at the surface and bedrock depth. In this second part of the thesis, a new methodology for the selection of ground motion time histories for numerical ground response analyses over vast areas is developed. The proposed procedure takes advantage of unsupervised machine learning techniques to define areas for which it is reasonable to assume the same sets of time histories based on the similarity of the seismic hazard.\nThe last part of this dissertation deals with the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) of the study area. The PSHA is carried out adopting the partially non-ergodic approach (e.g., Rodriguez-Marek et al., 2011; Kotha et al., 2017), and considering the updated assumptions about the seismogenic model and ground motion prediction equations. As one of the scopes of this study is to evaluate the impact of the computed site amplifications on the Po Plain seismic hazard rather than performing the best PSHA possible, only the uncertainty in the soil amplification is considered in the calculations.\nThe results of this thesis are compared to those provided by previous studies, where soil amplification factors are computed. Finally, the results of this thesis are also compared to those provided by the current Italian building code, so as to evaluate the impact of the different factors on the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment of the study area", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-05052020-130841", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1599221880000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262073000, "depositedDate": 1596236400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Long-period site effects in the Po Plain sedimentary basin (Italy)", "topics": ["GEO/11"], "types": [], "year": 2023, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/328847674", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-05052020-130841/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-05052020-130841", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "14699548", "authors": ["CARLINI, SERENA"], "contributors": ["Foschi, Marina", "Soffritti, Marcello"], "datePublished": "2050-06-29T00:00:00", "description": "In multilingual systems, such as the European Union, the phenomenon of the semantic variation of special languages is faced with terminological and juridical system bound problems.

Automation-assisted production is however mostly open-loop and requires checkpoints to perform product quality analysis. Early vision-based systems were therefore developed since the nineties. This approach worked very well for those activities in which the critical issues can be formally expressed by means of geometrical properties (e.g. measures) or the presence/absence of well-known features on the inspected objects.\nHowever, to date, there are still many quality-control activities that cannot be performed by automated vision inspection machines. Their use is limited by the need to express the checks to be performed as a predefined sequence of actions in which each of them must be carefully designed to fit the specific production requirements. Nevertheless, many of the checks which can be easily learned by humans, are extremely difficult to be formally described using a set of static rules. The major difference relies on the fact that humans can exploit their experience as a relevant evaluation criterion while assessing the quality of a product. On the other hand, implementing such feature on an automated vision inspection machine requires the development of novel algorithms which can be trained and improved with time and experience. Early attempts using traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and other learning tools dramatically failed due to the complexity of modeling in rigid mathematical structures the vast set of rules required to model the expertise.\nIn the last few years, the research on Deep Neural Network (DNN) brought new interest in the field of machine learning based on ANNs. In particular, it has been shown that, given enough data, a DNN can be successfully used to perform complex computer vision tasks such as object classification, object detection and image segmentation. Those networks showed several interesting features, such as experience-based learning, scalability, and performances similar (and in some cases even superior) to human beings. Moreover, with respect to previous ANN approaches, these networks have the advantage that they do not require anymore explicit efforts to describe optimized features extraction algorithms.\nThis Thesis work has the aim to map the human learning ability from experience into an equivalent learning-from-data capability of a DNN. The effectiveness of this approach has been proved in a real application for the inspection of welding defects on the assembly line of fuel injectors. We designed and assessed an automated defect analysis system based on deep learning. The Thesis covered all the development steps from early concept design, specification design, development of a prototype, software design and finally the development of a complete system which will be integrated into the assembly line. The hardware and software have been designed for all the system components, from the acquisition of the images to the communication of the analysis results to the enterprise PLC. Most of the efforts have been put in the design of the network architecture and on the definition of the training procedure. Starting from state-of-the-art deep architectures and using the transfer learning technique, it has been possible to train a network with about 7 millions parameters using a reduced number of injectors images, obtaining an accuracy of 97.22%.\nThe realization of this Thesis has been made possible thanks to the collaboration with Continental Automotive Italy S.p.A and their interest in the Industry 4.0 research topics to bring intelligence in the manufacturing processes.\nSo far, the system described in this work has been successfully tested on the assembly line and will enter into production starting from June 2018. We already provided intelligence in the system so that during the early phases of operation, it will collect new images to extend the existing dataset and to improve further its performance. With this Thesis work, we showed that deep neural networks can successfully perform quality inspection tasks which are actually done by humans. The approach, the system and the methodology described here can be also easily extended and applied to other applications", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04182018-140206", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1557245778000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262012000, "depositedDate": 1552521600000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Automated Defect Analysis of Mechanical Components using Deep Learning-Based Computer Vision", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'INFORMAZIONE"], "types": [], "year": 2088, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/199172230", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04182018-140206/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04182018-140206", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "328874236", "authors": ["Egea, Santiago", "Li-Lin, Pau", "Radeva, Petia"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "2025-07-28T00:00:00", "description": "Requeriments t\u00e8cnics: The software requires at least 6GB of ram.L'acc\u00e9s al manual i al codi no estar\u00e0 disponible fins la fi de la data d'embargament.

Ambient air-sampled pollen from Munich in 2016 and 2017 was visually identified from reference pollens and extracts were prepared. The extracts were lyophilized, rehydrated in optimal NMR buffers, and filtered to remove large proteins. NMR spectra were analyzed for pollen associated metabolites.

The 2D soft robotic arm is composed of two modules where each module consists of two pneumatic actuators and can extend and bend. Though DRL has been explored in the soft robotics realm, end-to-end training has not been developed. Herein, this thesis presents an end-to-end training from snapshots of the simulation to control policy guiding the soft robotic arm to reach a designated target using DRL, and proofs the validity and stability of this approach. The soft robotic arm is able to reach the target with a 98.1% success rate after approximately 30 epochs of training both for fixed initial position training and varying initial position training. The methodology presented here can be generalized for intelligent motion planning and control of soft robotic systems that are otherwise challenging.U of I OnlyAuthor requested U of Illinois access only (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108623", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1602815291000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571499000, "depositedDate": 1602307019000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Deep reinforcement learning control of a 2D soft robotic arm", "topics": ["deep Q network", "deep reinforcement learning", "soft robotic arm", "control"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/334979984", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/108623"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108623", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "334980093", "authors": ["Huang, Yizhi"], "contributors": ["Peng, Jian"], "datePublished": "2022-10-07T22:50:13", "description": "An effective real-time crop cover classification prediction is essential to real-time large-scale\ncrop monitoring. High resolution satellite optical data containing distinguishable signals of\ndifferent crop types have been used by recent crop cover classification studies. However,\nexisting works that merely use satellite information fail to reach a high accuracy, especially\nin the early growing season (before July) because of lacking informative satellite scenes\nthat can be used to effectively distinguish crops. In this work, we present a deep-learning-\nbased method, named BlueBird, to accurately classify crop cover types in real-time at the\nnational scale. BlueBird consists of three sub-models: prior-knowledge model, real-time\noptical model, and real-time weight model. Historical planting information, sequence of\nplanted crop types in past years, is incorporated into the prior-knowledge model to improve\nthe performance, especially in the pre and early season when satellite images do not contain\ndistinguishable crop signals. Available satellite optical data is used by the real-time optical\nmodel to extract spatial and temporal information that can be used to classify the crops.\nFinally, BlueBird integrates historical crop planting information with spatial and temporal\npatterns discovered from satellite time series using a trainable real-time weight model that\nevolves over time, thereby allowing the satellite-based model to be increasingly dominant as\nmore observation data are available. We also propose a national acreage model based on\nBlueBird\u2019s real-time prediction to predict the national acreage of two major crops, corn and\nsoybean. We conduct leave-one-year-out validations in the whole U.S. Corn Belt from 2014\nto 2019 to evaluate the real-time performance of BlueBird. We generate F1 score maps thatcompare BlueBird\u2019s predictions with CDL and scatter plots that compare BlueBird\u2019s county-\nlevel acreage with NASS\u2019s ground truth to demonstrate the large-scale effectiveness. In the\nmap of June 1, we can see that corn belt counties where corn and soybean are dominant\ncrop types generally reach 0.8 F1 score. Same promising results can be concluded from\nthe scatter plot of June 1, that for both corn and soybean, most years reach a r 2 above\n0.85. From the accuracy map and scatter plot on August 30 , we can see the significant\nimprovement from initial predictions to end-of-season predictions. In the detailed analysis\nof Champaign, Illinois, BlueBird achieves F1 scores of 0.88 on June 1 for all the validation\nyears and end-of-season F1 scores above 0.95 for all years except 2019 when historic flooding\nand precipitation happens. We use BlueBird\u2019s prediction to evaluate our national acreage\nmodel using the ground truth released by NASS. Error of Corn acreage has a RMSE of\n2.12% on June 1 and a RMSE of 1.36% on August 30. Error of soybean acreage (2014 to2018) has a RMSE of 1.70% on June 1 and a RMSE of 0.85% on August 30. The extensive\nresults demonstrate that BlueBird is capable of generating highly accurate real-time crop\ncover in national-scale and the national acreage model is effective in predicting corn and\nsoybean acreages.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108732", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1602815292000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571500000, "depositedDate": 1602307188000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "BlueBird: national-scale real-time crop cover classification using multi-stage deep learning approach", "topics": ["Crop Type", "Satellite Image", "Land Cover", "Real Time Crop Type Classification", "Real Time Land Cover Classification"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/334980093", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/108732"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108732", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "287625068", "authors": ["Sanchez-Walker, Noelia"], "contributors": ["Montrul, Silvina A", "Montrul, Silvina A", "Ionin, Tania", "Bowles, Melissa", "Jegerski, Jill", "Foote, Rebecca"], "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:39:04", "description": "This study investigated comprehension of complex syntax in Spanish, namely passive and relative clauses, by early English-Spanish bilinguals, also known as heritage language (HL) learners, and by second language (L2) learners. To contribute to current theoretical debates on the role of input and age in L2 and bilingual language acquisition, and to current pedagogical inquires on how instruction can be beneficial for HL learners, this study sought to find out whether age of onset of meaningful exposure (and consequently type of L2/HL input and experience) affected adult L2 learners and heritage speakers\u2019 knowledge of these structures, which are acquired early (by age 3 or 4) but are most frequently used and mastered at a later age during the school-age period. This study also investigated whether language learning experience, for late bilinguals after adolescence as a second language (L2) in a classroom; for early bilinguals, from birth as heritage language (HL) in informal familiar settings, affect their performance in tasks of oral and written modalities. Given that these structures are mastered during the school-age period, this study also focuses on how instruction in Spanish from pre-K to graduate school affect comprehension of these clauses.\n\nRelative clauses are embedded clauses that modify a noun phrase (NP), the head of the main clause, which in this study were either in the subject or in the object position. In Spanish, relative clauses involve a type of wh-movement where a special null wh-word referred to as an operator (Op) in the deep structure moves to the Spec of the CP. When the operator moves, it leaves a trace or a gap within the clause. Although many factors affect processing of relative clauses, it is generally agreed that the linear distance (LD) between the head and the gap accounts for the ease or difficulty processing subject relative and object relative clauses, at least in head-initial languages. The relative clauses in this study were subject and object relative clauses with inanimate NPs and reversible and plausible contexts in which either the subject or the object could perform the action described by the verb in the complementizer phrase (CP). The sentences were designed to control for plausibility to prevent a context bias favoring one interpretation or another. The only way for the learners to determine which NP was the subject or the object in the clause was by processing the inflectional morphology of the verb that agreed with the subject. Only third person singular and plural verb conjugations were used. \n\nIn examples (1) and (2) the linear distance in words between the head and the gap is shorter in the subject relative clause than in the object relative clause.\n\n(1) Subject Relative Clause (SR) \n\nThe submarineSUBJECT that ____ sankVERB the boatsOBJECT.     LD = 1 word\n\n(2) Object Relative Clause (OR) \n\nThe submarineOBJECT that the boatsSUBJECT sankVERB _____.    LD = 4 words\n\nWhile English relatives are constructed with one word order, Spanish relatives can be constructed with two, showing different linear distances between the head and the gap. Relative clauses in examples (3) and (4) have the same word order as English relative clauses.\n\n(3) SR  El submarinoSUBJECT que _____ hundi\u00f3VERB los barcosOBJECT.  LD = 1 word\n\n(4) OR  El submarinoOBJECT que los barcosSUBJECT hundieronVERB _____. LD = 4 words\n\nAnd examples (5) and (6) show the other possible word order for SR, with Verb-Object inversion, and for OR, with Subject-Verb inversion, respectively. The SR in (5) is extremely rare in the input.\n\n(5) SR  El submarinoSUBJECT que los barcosOBJECT _____ hundi\u00f3VERB.  LD = 3 words\n\n(6) OR  El submarinoOBJECT que hundieronVERB _____ los barcosSUBJECT. LD = 2 words\n\nObject relatives OR (OSV) were expected to be harder to comprehend than SR (SVO) based on the linear distance between the head and the gap. Furthermore, the ease of comprehension of relative clauses was expected to vary based on the LD in words in the following manner: SR(SVO) >OR(OVS)>SR(SOV>OR(OSV), where \u2018>\u2019 means \u2018easier than\u2019.\n\nThe other structure tested was passive clauses. Passive clauses included verbal and adjectival passive clauses with the copulas in the imperfect tense era and estaba, respectively. See (7) and (8). Comprehension of verbal passive clauses, as opposed to the comprehension of adjectival passive clauses, was predicted to be more difficult for both groups of leaners. First, there is a canonical construction for the verbal passive clause in the past with the copula in the preterite tense fue, with which learners are more familiar. Second, another passive voice construction, the reflexive passive, also known as morphological passive or se-passive, is more frequent in Spanish. Third, the verbal passive clause with the copula in the imperfect tense in HL and L2 acquisition is not common in oral communication. And, last, the imperfect tense is vulnerable to incomplete acquisition in L2 and HL learners\u2019 grammars. \n\nThis study was designed with truncated passive clauses with actional verbs and irreversible contexts, meaning that the theme could not perform the action stated by the verb. Instead the theme was always the object of, or was in a state resulting from the action stated by the verb.\n\n(7) La comida estaba servida.    Adjectival/ Stative Passive\n\ndinner was (estar.IMPERFECT) served.\n\n\u2018Dinner was served.\u2019\n\n\n(8) La comida era servida.    Verbal/Eventive Passive\n\ndinner was (ser.IMPERFECT) served.\n\n\u2018Dinner was being served.\u2019\n\n\nUnlike adjectival passives, verbal passive clauses trigger a reanalysis of the sentence to organize the thematic roles. To comprehend adjectival/stative passives with participles, learners had to realize that a description of a state or final result followed the copula estar. To comprehend verbal passive clauses, learners had to know that the first noun phrase was not the agent, but the object. The reanalysis is triggered at the past participle in English (Mack, Meltzer-Asscher, Barbieri, & Thompson, 2013). In this dissertation it is assumed that Spanish reanalysis involves the copula. If the copula was ser, the clause was a verbal passive not an adjectival passive. When processing the copula, learners had to integrate the meaning of the imperfect form era, which refers to an ongoing or habitual action in the past. L2 and HL learners are familiar with passive voice structures and they have been shown to be familiar with the canonical passive clause with fue in Spanish. Thus, comprehension of these passive clauses required not only knowledge of its syntax, but also of the complementary distribution of ser and estar. Acquiring the complementary distribution of the copulas is a hard task for L2 learners and HL learners as they need to acquire not only their irregular inflectional morphology but also the contrasts between each copula regarding syntax, semantics and pragmatics, a contrast that is not present in English.\n\n116 participants completed an aural and a written version of a Picture Matching Task created to test comprehension of these clauses. They also completed an aural and written version of a Grammaticality Judgment Task to test basic grammar knowledge needed to comprehend these structures, and their linguistic history was recorded in a bilingual language questionnaire. Their proficiency was measured with a written test (DELE) and an oral narrative coded to calculate the moving average type-token ratio (MATTR), mean length of utterance (MLU) and fluency in words per minute.\n\nResults showed that SR(SVO) and OR(OSV) were both easily comprehended by both groups of learners. The fact that SR(SVO) and OR(OSV) show the same word order as their English counterparts might explain the result. A study with speakers of another L1 with different word order (i.e. Chinese, Korean, Turkish) would be needed to confirm this possibility with more certainty. Contrary to the prediction based on the LD, comprehension of SR(SOV) was low, which is explained by how infrequent they are in the input. OR (OVS) were interpreted as SR (SVO) by L2 and HL learners of lower proficiency. As written DELE proficiency increased so did correct interpretation of OR(OVS) for HL and L2 learners. The prediction based on the LD was not borne out and highlights the importance of extra-linguistic factors in the comprehension of these clauses. Frequency of the structure affects comprehension of relative clauses, and so does written and oral proficiency. \n\nResults for passive clauses showed that L2 and HL learners were more accurate with adjectival passive clauses than with verbal passive clauses. These difficulties in the comprehension of verbal passive clauses show that learners have not yet acquired the full spectrum of copula uses and interpreted era in the verbal passive clause as estaba in an adjectival passive clause, a simpler construction. \n\nBesides comprehension of these structures, this study investigated how age of meaningful exposure to Spanish, modality of task, and instruction in the HL/L2 language from pre-K to graduate school affected comprehension of these clauses.\n\nResults from the comprehension of passive and relative clauses show age of meaningful exposure to Spanish as a robust predictor of successful language acquisition. HL learners were significantly more accurate than L2 learners in the comprehension of passive clauses and significantly more accurate in the comprehension of the object relative clause OR-OVS. This indicates that early exposure to Spanish confers HL learners an advantage in the comprehension of clauses with complex syntax.\n\nRegarding task modality, L2 and HL learners\u2019 linguistic experience influences their abilities with language tasks because each experience emphasizes different language skills (Bowles, 2011b; Montrul, 2016). L2 learners\u2019 meaningful exposure to Spanish in the classroom helps them develop metalinguistic or explicit knowledge of the language, and hence they tend to perform well in tasks that target metalinguistic knowledge. HL learners also have limited meaningful exposure to the language, but their exposure is mostly aural in informal settings with family and community. They do not have significant experience writing or reading the HL, and, typically do not have metalinguistic knowledge of the HL (Montrul, 2008b, 2016). Because their experience with the language is mostly aural, they tend to perform better in aural tasks that tap on implicit knowledge, or on intuitive information (Bowles, 2011a; Montrul, Foote, & Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, 2008a; Montrul & Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, 2011). Results showed that modality affected comprehension of both groups of learners but with different clauses. L2 learners performed significantly better in the written modality with relative clauses, while HL learners performed significantly better in the aural modality with passive clauses. \n\nThis thesis also focused on how instruction interacted with age of meaningful exposure in the acquisition of complex syntax. Results showed that instruction significantly accounted for L2 learners\u2019 comprehension of passive clauses, but not for comprehension of relative clauses. Although instruction did not account for HL learners\u2019 comprehension of any of the clauses, an important finding of this dissertation is that instruction in Spanish could be more fruitful for HL learners if it starts in elementary school. Early instruction and language use at an early age conferred advantages to HL learners in the comprehension of verbal passive clauses with era. The data suggested that parental Spanish use with learners (input), combined with learners\u2019 Spanish language use with parents (output), and early frequent Spanish use (between the ages of 6 and 10) positively influenced comprehension of verbal passive clauses with era. Moreover, the data suggested that early bilingual education could be a contributing factor too.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106477", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1583963570000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571449000, "depositedDate": 1583188757000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Comprehension of Spanish relative and passive clauses by early bilinguals and second language learners", "topics": ["Heritage Language, Early bilingual, bilingualism, second language acquisition, Complex clauses, relative clauses, passive clauses, task modality, second language instruction, proficiency, oral proficiency, language comprehension"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/287625068", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106477"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106477", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "287625095", "authors": ["Sundar, Sreenath"], "contributors": ["Salapaka, Srinivasa M"], "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:39:04", "description": "My thesis broadly explores different data-driven algorithmic frameworks for solving two class of problems pertaining to heat-exchangers: temperature control and fouling resistance modeling and prediction.\n\nDesigning robust and accurate temperature controllers for heat exchangers is very challenging primarily because of complexities associated with the synthesis of dynamics of industrial heat exchangers. It is practically infeasible to synthesize an accurate dynamical model of heat-exchanger's flow and heat transfer physics because of unmodeled system dynamics and random noise. The use of non-model based control approaches such as PI control is limited by the challenges faced in the accurate tuning of its parameters. Further, an optimally tuned PI controller will not be universally applicable across the entire operating range of heat-exchanger's outlet temperatures due to changing controller set-points caused by large-scale stochastic fluctuations in the heat exchanger's flow and temperature inputs. We propose a couple of data-driven temperature control solutions for heat-exchangers based on $n$-step advance deep neural networks and a hybrid control approach based on steady state neural network with a proportional controller. We compared the performance of these two control approaches with PI control and open loop (no control) scenarios on a simulated water-air heat exchanger system. The heat-exchanger control objective was to accurately track the user-defined set-point temperature signal at the air-outlet duct of the heating coil system. We assess the response characteristics of the developed control approaches for two set-point temperature signals- a constant temperature and a high frequency (periodic) square pulse. We obtained over 70% reduction in absolute set-point temperature tracking error compared to a PI controller, over a 50-minute duration for both the developed control approaches. Further, we explained the working of the neural network + proportional control module in great detail along with the rationale behind our design choices for ensuring the controller's stability and robustness.  \n\nThe complexities involved in fouling prediction in heat-exchangers have deterred traditional model based approaches and other empirical methods. Many existing data-driven prediction approaches are typically application-driven or heat-exchanger specific. Hence, these algorithms are limited either by the scale of data they can handle or by the geometrical and flow configurations of the heat-exchanger for which they were conceived. Here, we develop a generalized and scalable statistical model for accurate prediction of fouling resistance using commonly measured parameters of industrial heat-exchangers. This prediction model is based on deep learning which is a family of computational data-driven methods that allows a scalable algorithmic architecture to learn non-linear functional relationships between a set of target and predictor variables from large number of training samples. The efficacy of this modeling approach is demonstrated for predicting fouling in a simulation of a flue-gas and water cross flow heat exchanger designed for waste-heat recovery. The results demonstrate that the average coefficient of determination, which quantifies the accuracy of predictions is over 99% in predicting flue-gas side, water side and overall fouling resistances. This prediction framework is also evaluated under varying levels of input noise and it was demonstrated that averaging predictions over an ensemble of multiple neural networks achieves better accuracy and robustness to noise. We find that the proposed deep-learning fouling prediction framework learns to follow heat-exchanger flow and heat transfer physics, which we confirm using locally interpretable model agnostic explanations around randomly selected operating points.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106504", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1583963570000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571450000, "depositedDate": 1583188760000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Learning based algorithms for temperature control and fouling prediction in heat-exchangers", "topics": ["Heat Exchanger Fouling", "Deep Learning", "PI Controller", "Temperature Controller", "Neural Controller", "Artificial Intelligence", "Hybrid Control", "Cross-flow Heat Exchanger", "Waste Heat Recovery", "Ensemble Models", "Neural Networks", "Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/287625095", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106504"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106504", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "147479396", "authors": ["Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez, Aitor"], "contributors": ["Conde P\u00e9rez, Ronny", "Universidad de Cantabria"], "datePublished": "2022-09-29T00:00:00", "description": "Grado en Ingenier\u00eda en Electr\u00f3nica Industrial y Autom\u00e1tic", "identifiers": ["oai:repositorio.unican.es:10902/12059", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2259", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "UCrea", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1518156988000, "metadataUpdated": 1611614683000, "depositedDate": 1507330800000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/bachelorThesis"], "title": "Autonomous drone navigation based on Deep Reinforcement Learning", "topics": [], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/147479396", "http://hdl.handle.net/10902/12059"], "oai": "oai:repositorio.unican.es:10902/12059", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "344683570", "authors": ["Ferraz, Francisco Il\u00eddio Maia da Rocha"], "contributors": ["Alves, M\u00e1rio Jorge de Andrade Ferreira"], "datePublished": "2023-07-07T00:00:00", "description": "Este documento tem como objetivo a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o do trabalho desenvolvido ao longo do 2o semestre para a cadeira de Tese / Disserta\u00e7\u00e3o, focando-se na proje\u00e7\u00e3o e implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo de Estima\u00e7\u00e3o de Estados, aplicado ao Centro de Telecomando das Centrais Hidroel\u00e9tricas da EDP Produ\u00e7\u00e3o.

These models consist on a set of algorithms, aimed at making real time value predictions, using an historical database of previous events. The set of input parameters, that the model will use to produce a final output, will be obtained from direct readings from the Supervisory and Data Acquisition System. Being responsible for the management and operation of the hydroelectric powerplants, the Hydroelectric Remote Control Center needs to have a way of monitoring and detecting possible anomalies in the data coming from the plants, so that operators are able to act accordingly. Many of the activities of the teams involve remote conduction of the facilities and guaranteeing that the work is made in compliance with the existing standards. The existence of a monitoring system of this kind allows them to focus on their day to day tasks, as any event out of the ordinary will be captured model. The main purpose of this work is to study Machine Learning applications already that exist in the current market, as well as to understand what kind of technologies are part of this type of products, in order to gain a better understanding on how these solutions can be developed. Based on the previous analysis, the highlight of the project moves to the preparation of the state estimation model, using the Python language and the Tensorflow framework to create a neural network. The goal of this model is to validate the current water storage levels, according to a specific set of pre-established criteria, providing a deep analysis, and error detections, of the measures registered in the power plants.

This model can be obtained by using image-based or image-free techniques. Image-based techniques rely on the segmentation of pre-operative scans. Segmentation is typically done manually, which is a time-consuming process that requires technical expertise. Image-free techniques were developed to avoid this preoperative step and rely on intraoperative surface scanning and bone morphing algorithms to create a patient-specific model during surgery. Recent advances in machine learning have aided the development of novel segmentation algorithms, which may eventually enable automation of the segmentation process in image-based techniques.\nIn this work, we assessed the accuracy of digital models of a cadaveric femur obtained using three different systems (manual segmentation, a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm and a commercial image-free surgical system), by comparing them to high resolution optical scans of the exposed femur, which is used here as the gold standard.\nOne cadaveric knee was used for this study. Ethical approval was obtained from the Imperial College Healthcare Tissue Bank (project R13066-3A) and the cadaveric knee was sourced from an approved supplier. The intact sample was scanned using a Siemens Spectra MRI system to obtain the images needed for the image-based procedures.\nManual segmentation of the femur bone and cartilage was performed in 3D-Slicer by thresholding, followed by manual adjustment. A 3D model of the segmented volume was then generated using the same software.\nThe automated segmentation was performed using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed by Kayalibay et al. The neural network was trained to classify voxels into five categories (femur bone, femur cartilage, tibia bone, tibia cartilage, other) using 70 MRI volumes of the knee, available from the SKI10 challenge. Training required approximately 41 hours on an NVIDIA Tesla K80 Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). After training, the same neural network was used to segment an MRI scan of the specimen. The label maps obtained from the network were then converted into a 3D model using Matlab R2018a.\nThe knee specimen was prepared for optical surface scanning by attaching it to a custom-made metal rig using bone cement and exposing the distal end of the femur by performing a vertical cut as in a Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).\nTo obtain a gold standard measurement, 12 high resolution scans of the visible part of the femur head were obtained from different positions and orientations, using a Polyga HDI C210 3D Scanner. The scans were then aligned and merged using the FlexScan3D software, available from the camera manufacturer.\nThe specimen was then digitised using a commercial image-free surgical system. To this end, a reference array was attached to the femur using bone pins and, after standard calibration, the visible part of the femur was digitised using the system\u2019s probe. After this, the system\u2019s log files were downloaded to a USB drive to access the computed surface model.\nThe 3D models obtained with the different modalities were imported into Matlab as point clouds and were registered to the gold standard using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method. To summarise the accuracy of each method, the root mean square error (RMSE) was computed for each modality.\nManual segmentation is confirmed here to be the most accurate method, but it requires expertise and time. Hence, in order to alleviate the task for clinicians, image-free systems have gained in popularity.\nOur results show that the accuracy of a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm is still worse than with other methods, but inching towards the ballpark figure for image-free systems, albeit with the need for preoperative imaging of the patient, which would add time and cost to a navigated procedure.\nThese results suggest that machine-learning methods could become a powerful alternative to currently available segmentation techniques. With the attention that these methods have been receiving in recent years, and the rapid development of hardware and software tools for deep learning, the quality and speed of execution of these methods will continue to improve in the coming years, with a consequent impact on their speed, robustness, and overall accuracy", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04082019-175452", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1558627342000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262039000, "depositedDate": 1558306800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "An assessment of automatic segmentation of the knee joint based on machine learning", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'INFORMAZIONE"], "types": [], "year": 2089, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/200255776", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04082019-175452/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04082019-175452", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "14697040", "authors": ["LONETTI, GIUSEPPINA"], "contributors": ["Strettoi, Enrica", "Pizzorusso, Tommaso"], "datePublished": "2049-02-19T00:00:00", "description": "La regolazione della trascrizione genica avviene a diversi livelli, dal DNA alle proteine, per mezzo di svariati meccanismi.

The diagnostic power of an ECG is related to the ability to timely and accurately identify specific heartbeat alterations (arrhythmia). Several approaches to the automated analysis of ECG signals have been proposed so far, in the attempt to improve the quality of arrhythmia detection.\nThe ECG signal, like many other biological signals, is generally non-linear, non-stationary, dynamic and complex: this hampers the extraction of characteristics to be used for any algorithmic analysis, with a severe impact on the efficiency of the overall diagnostic procedure. Specifically, the complexity of the ECG signal is related to the high variability of wave-form morphologies both for the same patient and across different patients, plus problems in the placements of electrodes on the patient\u2019s body.\nThis work aims to increase the accuracy and speed of ECG diagnostic systems with respect to the real-time detection of arrhythmia events. A deep learning (DL) approach is proposed as a means to deal with the high variability in ECG signals. The implemented neural network has shown to be able to detect, starting from raw data, high-level ECG characteristics, with good generalization ability.\nThe work is developed according to an \"intra-patient\" paradigm: the network is trained not only using generic samples, but also exploiting patient-specific data. The network consists of three convolutional layers, which are in charge of extracting features out of morphological information in ECG signals; subsequently, by considering also temporal features, the previous information is fed to a multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) to finalize the classification job.\nThe performance evaluation of the developed classifier has been carried out taking into account different pre-processing strategies, best representation of morphological and temporal features, data augmentation techniques and fine-tuning strategies.\nThe results over a classical, standard benchmark database (MIT-BIH DB), show that the network performance is comparable (and in some cases superior) to what it has been obtained in other works with the same paradigm.\nIn accordance with the AAMI recommendations, the most challenging classes to identify are the Supraventricular Ectopic Beat (SVEB) and the Ventricular Ectopic Beat (VEB). For this reason, the performance on this class, based on Sensitivity (Sen) and Positive predicted value (Ppv), are representative of the effective robustness of the overall approach. The network reaches 60.21% and 79.85% for the SVEB class and 91.05% and 95.34% for the VEB class in terms of Sen and Ppv respectively.\nSuch results show the competitive performance of this work with respect to the state-of-the-art.\nFinally, it is important to underline that the shallow depth of the network, as well as the limited number of steps to get to the final classification of input data, make the proposed system particularly well suited for real-time analysis in embedded devices", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-01282020-161049", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1599221868000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262066000, "depositedDate": 1598310000000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Development of a deep learning system for patient-specific real-time arrhythmia detection: Addressing choice of features and data imbalance", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'INFORMAZIONE"], "types": [], "year": 2090, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/328847510", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-01282020-161049/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-01282020-161049", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "237083179", "authors": ["SEVERINI, SILVIA"], "contributors": ["Bacciu, Davide"], "datePublished": "2089-10-04T00:00:00", "description": "Nowadays, almost every aspect of life depends on reliable high-quality software so there is a high demand for software tools that could help this development process.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are two common types of neural networks that have a successful history in capturing temporal and spatial features of texts. By using RNN, we can encode input text to a lower space of semantic features while considering the sequential behavior of words. By using CNN, we can transfer the representation of input text to a flat structure to be used for classifying text. In this article, we proposed a novel recurrent CNN model to capture not only the temporal but also the spatial features of the input poem/verse to be used for poet identification. Considering the shortcomings of the normal RNNs, we try both long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit units in the proposed architecture and apply them to the poet identification task. There are a large number of poems in the history of literature whose poets are unknown. Considering the importance of the task inthe information processing field, a great variety of methods from traditional learning models, such as support vector machine and logistic regression, to deep neural network models, such as CNN, have been proposed to address this problem. Our experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models for poet identification by receiving either a poem or a single verse as input.

Conventional use of this material is often seen in applications such as excavatable landfilling or thermal isolation. Different from solid material, this cellularized cementitious foam tends to exhibit extensive plastic deformation when loaded to failure, accompanied by considerable energy dissipation. Taking advantage of this crushable nature, a novel usage of foam concrete is found in impact-absorbing applications. Unlike structural concrete, the functional application of foam concrete also shows good feasibility for accommodating high-volume recycled fine particles. This potential brings a promising prospect to pursue the green engineering concept with foam concrete. However, the implementation of this material as an energy absorber is awaiting a more in-depth investigation of its key material attributes to the mechanical especially crushing performance.\nIn this dissertation, several critical aspects of the mechanical performance of lightweight foam concrete are investigated using a series of advanced characterization techniques, as well as computational approaches. The elastic modulus of foam concrete is measured via a nondestructive vibrational frequency test. The crushing behavior is characterized based on the load-displacement response in a penetration test. Build on these, further attention is paid to the foam densification phenomenon using correlation analysis, digital image correlation (DIC), and X-ray computed tomography (CT). The material failure process of foam concrete is explained based on the experimental observations. A constitutive relationship is further established for elaborating the relationship between foam densification and mechanical performance. Using the measured material properties, the crushing behavior of foam concrete is investigated using a smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation, where good agreements with the experimental observations are obtained. Subsequently, a more complex crushing scenario is investigated, in which an aircraft wheel crushing on a lightweight foam concrete pavement is modeled. This simulation yields a realistic prediction of the arresting performance of the engineered material arresting system (EMAS) made of foam concrete during an overrun. With respect to the fine particle inclusion in foam concrete, its effect on different properties of foam concrete is investigated, which primarily includes foam geometry, fundamental frequency, elastic modulus, crushing response, compressive strength, as well as drying shrinkage.\nAs a side project of this Ph.D. study, two featured studies on concrete petrographic analysis are also included in this dissertation. The first one is using deep learning-based concrete image segmentation. The second is predicting the 3D concrete freeze-thaw protection based on 2D imaging.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106496", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1583963570000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571450000, "depositedDate": 1583188759000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Evaluation of foam concrete physical properties and mechanical response under indentation", "topics": ["foam concrete", "cellular concrete", "solid foam", "mechanical property", "crushing", "energy absorption", "impact absorption"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/287625087", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106496"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106496", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "328785562", "authors": ["Gong, Hongyu"], "contributors": ["Bhat, Suma", "Bhat, Suma", "Viswanath, Pramod", "Srikant, Rayadurgam", "Hwu, Wen-mei", "Fanti, Giulia"], "datePublished": "2022-08-26T23:58:55", "description": "How to properly represent language is a crucial and fundamental problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Language representation learning aims to encode rich information such as the syntax and semantics of the language into dense vectors. It facilitates the modeling, manipulation and analysis of natural language in computational linguistics. Existing algorithms utilize corpus statistics such as word co-occurrences to learn general-purpose language representation. Recent advances in generic representation integrate intensive information such as contextualized features from unlabeled text corpora.\n\nIn this dissertation, we continue this line of research to incorporate rich knowledge into generic embeddings. We show that word representation could be enriched with various information including temporal and spatial variations as well as syntactic functionalities, and that text representation could be refined with topical knowledge. Moreover, we develop an insight into the geometry of pre-trained representation, and connect it to the semantic understanding such as identifying the idiomatic word usage. \n\nBesides generic representation, task-dependent representation is also extensively studied in downstream applications, where the representation is trained to encode domain information from labeled datasets. This dissertation leverages the capability of neural network models to integrate the task-specific supervision into language representations. We introduce new deep learning models and algorithms to train representations with external knowledge in annotated data. It is shown that the learned representation can assist in various downstream tasks in language understanding such as text classification and language generation such as text style transfer.U of I OnlyAuthor requested U of Illinois access only (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108110", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1599185966000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571490000, "depositedDate": 1598482745000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Representation learning of natural language and its application to language understanding and generation", "topics": ["Natural Language Processing", "Representation Learning", "Language Understanding", "Language Generation"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/328785562", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/108110"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108110", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "190372546", "authors": ["Barbosa, Bruno Miguel da Silva"], "contributors": ["Fernandes, Ant\u00f3nio Ramires", "Ferreira, Manuel Jo\u00e3o Oliveira"], "datePublished": "2022-01-01T00:00:00", "description": "Disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de mestrado em Computer ScienceComputer vision is a vast knowledge subject responsible for traducing digital images and\r\nvideos into a higher level of understandable information.

Um\r\nfacto interessante sobre o DL, \u00e9 a sua capacidade para aprender dos dados e compreender\r\nas suas caracter\u00edsticas mais diferenciadoras.\r\nDo ponto de vista da ind\u00fastria, muitas linhas de inspec\u00e7\u00e3o via vis\u00e3o artificial ainda fazem\r\no seu trabalho atrav\u00e9s de m\u00e9todos/algoritmos tradicionais de vis\u00e3o por computador.

Computer-aided Design (CAD) software enables\r\nthe design of patient-specific cranial implants, therefore increasing the reliability of the\r\nreconstruction, but there is often a lack of appropriate software. Either the software is expensive\r\nto acquire which limits its availability or it is not user-friendly for clinicians and\r\ntherefore very time-consuming to use. This thesis proposes a Deep Learning (DL) approach\r\ntowards the automated CAD of cranial implants, allowing the design process to be less\r\nuser-dependent and even less time-consuming.\r\nThe problem of reconstructing a cranial defect, which is essentially filling in a hole in a skull,\r\nwas posed as a 3D shape completion task and, to solve it, a Volumetric Convolutional Denoising\r\nAutoencoder (DAE) was implemented using the open-source DL framework PyTorch.\r\nIn order to train the autoencoder, a large amount of 3D skull models was required, and\r\nthese were obtained by processing an open-access dataset of Magnetic Resonance Imaging\r\n(MRI) brain scans. The 3D skull models were represented as binary voxel occupancy grids\r\nand experiments were carried out for different voxel resolutions (303, 603 and 1203). For\r\neach experiment, the autoencoder was evaluated in terms of quantitative and qualitative 3D\r\nshape completion performance. The obtained results showed that the implemented Volumetric\r\nDAE is able to perform shape completion on 3D models of defected skulls, allowing\r\nfor an efficient and automatic reconstruction of cranial defects with a single forward pass\r\nof the trained model. Even though the current computational resources impose limitations\r\nin the resolution of the 3D skull models, the results presented in this thesis make it possible\r\nto conclude that DL can be considered a promising approach towards the automated\r\nreconstruction of cranial defects.O n\u00famero de cirurgias de reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de defeitos cranianos com recurso a implantes tem\r\nvindo a aumentar nos \u00faltimos anos. Software de Desenho assistido por Computador permite\r\nplanear implantes cranianos que sejam espec\u00edficos para cada paciente, tornando o processo\r\nde reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o mais fi\u00e1vel, mas tem-se vindo a verificar que h\u00e1 falta de software adequado.\r\nPor um lado, o software existente \u00e9 caro e portanto n\u00e3o est\u00e1 facilmente dispon\u00edvel. Por outro\r\nlado, n\u00e3o \u00e9 espec\u00edfico para uso m\u00e9dico e consequentemente a sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o acaba por ser\r\nbastante demorada. Esta tese tem como objetivo propor uma abordagem Deep Learning\r\ncomo forma de automatizar o Desenho assistido por Computador de implantes cranianos,\r\nde modo a que este processo seja menos dependente do utilizador e menos demorado.\r\nO problema da reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de um defeito craniano consiste essencialmente em preencher\r\numa lacuna no cr\u00e2nio, pelo que para tal, foi implementado um Volumetric Convolutional Denoising\r\nAutoencoder com recurso \u00e0 ferramenta open-source PyTorch. Contudo, para treinar o\r\nautoencoder, foi necess\u00e1ria uma grande quantidade de modelos 3D de cr\u00e2nios. Estes foram\r\nobtidos atrav\u00e9s do processamento de um dataset de imagens de Resson\u00e2ncia Magn\u00e9tica do\r\ncr\u00e2nio. Para os modelos 3D, foi adotada uma representa\u00e7\u00e3o bin\u00e1ria de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o dos v\u00f3xeis\r\ne foram experimentadas diferentes resolu\u00e7\u00f5es (303, 603 e 1203). Para cada experiencia, a performance\r\ndo autoencoder foi quantitativa e qualitativamente avaliada. Os resultados obtidos\r\ndemonstraram que o Volumetric Denoising Autoencoder implementado \u00e9 capaz de preencher\r\nas lacunas em modelos 3D de cr\u00e2nios defeituosos, permitindo assim uma reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o autom\u00e1tica e eficiente de defeitos cranianos atrav\u00e9s de um \u00fanico forward pass pelo modelo\r\ntreinado. Apesar de a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos modelos 3D de cr\u00e2nios estar limitada pelos recursos\r\ncomputacionais dispon\u00edveis, os resultados obtidos nesta tese permitem concluir que uma\r\nabordagem Deep Learning pode ser considerada promissora no sentido de automatizar a\r\nreconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de defeitos cranianos", "identifiers": ["oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/64157", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2274", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Universidade do Minho: RepositoriUM", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1585781774000, "metadataUpdated": 1610752168000, "depositedDate": 1583165151000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis"], "title": "Automated computer-aided design of cranial implants: a deep learning approach", "topics": ["Cranial implants", "Medical imaging", "Computer-aided design (CAD)", "Deep learning", "3D Shape completion", "Denoising autoencoders", "Implantes cranianos", "Imagem m\u00e9dica", "Desenho assistido por computador", "Engenharia e Tecnologia::Engenharia M\u00e9dica"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/289101761", "http://hdl.handle.net/1822/64157"], "oai": "oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/64157", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "232201880", "authors": ["Ruiz, Janete Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Soares Costa"], "contributors": ["Vieira, Maria Helena"], "datePublished": "2022-01-28T00:00:00", "description": "Tese de doutoramento em Estudos da Crian\u00e7a (Especialidade Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Musical)O ato de cantar comporta uma realidade m\u00faltipla tal como tem sido tratada por diversos autores:\r\nsalienta-se o ato de cantar como um processo psicomotor, como um comportamento social\r\ngerado pela atividade vocal, bem como um processo de autodesenvolvimento proporcionado pela\r\ndescoberta do instrumento vocal e das suas capacidades expressivas e comunicacionais desde a\r\nprimeira inf\u00e2ncia.

A an\u00e1lise dos dados foi de base indutiva e\r\ninterpretativa, tornando poss\u00edvel reconhecer a fun\u00e7\u00e3o did\u00e1tica da linguagem figurativa,\r\nidentificando-se um sentido pragm\u00e1tico de pendor t\u00e9cnico-expressivo na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de imagens e\r\nmet\u00e1foras como estrat\u00e9gia pedag\u00f3gica.

The voice\u2019s multidimensional properties makes\r\nit a special vehicle for musical learning and artistic development, unifying in one single process\r\nthe mobilization, strengthening and refinement of a psychomotor impulse, with the capacity of\r\nemotions, thoughts and aesthetic values communication.\r\nThe invisible condition of the vocal instrument leads, traditionally, to the use of figurative speech\r\nand imagery as a facilitator of technical guidance and performance skills developer, as the studies\r\nwith singing students and adult choirs confirm. The absence of studies focused in the children\u2019s\r\nperceptive response to figurative speech was the main motivation for this study, which is centred\r\nin the use and utility of this pedagogic tool. Starting with the question \u201cis figurative speech really a\r\nmean to enhance the acquisition and development of musical skills in children, and if so, how?\u201d\r\nwe developed a qualitative research, by means of a multiple case study. Two cases were studied\r\nin official schools, in generic and specialized regimes. The participants were six teachers and\r\nseven classes, with children from 6 to 18 year old. We aimed to gauge the circumstances,\r\nprevalence and advantages in the use of figurative speech in children and youth choir pedagogy,\r\nby identification of conceptual structures and mental schemes in teacher\u2019s speech, inferring how\r\nis participates in the music perception and acquisition of technical and interpretative skills. The\r\nstudy aimed also to promote discussion on the ways and means by which choral practice\r\nintegrates the musical learning process for children and young people in Portugal.\r\nStarting by deep bibliographic study, the main research instruments were interviews to teachers\r\nof generic and specialised branches and to choir singers, complemented with classes and\r\nrehearsals observation. The data analyse was inductive and interpretative, allowing to recognise\r\nthe didactic function of figurative speech. We identified a pragmatic sense, with technical and\r\nexpressive trend, in the use of figurative speech as a pedagogic tool. In the cases studied, we\r\nconclude that figurative speech assumes a rhetoric, aggregator and metacognitive function,\r\nrecognised by teachers and children, mainly in the specialised school setting, and being\r\nscattering represented in the generic school setting. By inducing and suggesting physical\r\nsensations, conducting to technical and acoustic predictable results, the figurative speech used in\r\nthis contexts lays down in the subject\u2019s metaphoric psychomotor roots and allowed the acquisition\r\nof technical and interpretative skills. By integrating life contexts, this practice has influence in the\r\npedagogic speech as well as in it\u2019s decoding, a fact that is highlighted by the children participating\r\nin this study. This allows us to conclude that the collective sense of imagery and metaphor is\r\nunderstood by children in choral settings according to their experience, conceptual or symbolic\r\nframe, creating an intersubjective space \u2013 the transformed musical practice \u2013 where each one\r\nparticipates in the global, significant and creative musical learning experience. An extended study\r\nto different age and social and cultural settings, can, in further research, add some new\r\ncontributions to the potentialities of figurative speech", "identifiers": ["oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/61741", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2274", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Universidade do Minho: RepositoriUM", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1572309144000, "metadataUpdated": 1610752188000, "depositedDate": 1570801138000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis"], "title": "A linguagem figurativa na pedagogia vocal coral infantil: Um estudo de caso m\u00faltiplo", "topics": ["Imag\u00e9tica", "Met\u00e1fora", "Coro infantil", "Pedagogia coral", "Imagery", "Metaphor", "Children Choir", "Choral Pedagogy", "Ci\u00eancias Sociais::Ci\u00eancias da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/232201880", "http://hdl.handle.net/1822/61741"], "oai": "oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/61741", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "95617188", "authors": ["Radeva, Petia", "Bola\u00f1os Sol\u00e0, Marc", "Soriano Oli\u00fa, Juan Luis", "Aguilar, Eduardo"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "2022-10-02T00:00:00", "description": "Requeriments t\u00e8cnics: Ubuntu (versi\u00f3 14.04), Anaconda (Python 2.7), Theano i KerasL'acc\u00e9s al manual i al codi no estar\u00e0 disponible fins la fi de la data d'embargament.

The localization of the source in the sky triggered an extensive follow-up campaign that led to the discovery of the electromagnetic counterpart, marking a new era for multimessenger astronomy.\nAt present, the data analysis pipelines of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration take few minutes from the arrival of a gravitational-wave signal to send an alert to the astronomical community, due to the computational cost of the algorithms that are used to detect the signal and determine the sky localization.\nReducing this time interval would enable astronomers to extract the maximum astrophysical information from the observation.\nDeep learning methods are particularly suitable to be used for low-latency analyses since the computationally intensive stage happens as a preliminary step during the so-called training phase in which the algorithm learns to extract the most important information from the data.

Instead of engineering algorithms by hand, the possibility to automatically train computing systems from huge amounts of data has led to an improvement of performances in important domains such as computer vision, robotics, web search, and speech recognition.\nNowadays, the most popular class of techniques used in these domains is called deep learning. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are compute-intensive learning models with growing applicability in a wide range of fields. These computing models have demonstrated their ability and effectiveness in solving complex learning problems, but they require complex and memory-intensive computations that make general-purpose CPUs ineffective to achieve reasonable performance levels. For instance, most of the modern DNN architectures include convolutional layers that have very high computational requirements that cannot be satisfied by even modern CPUs.\nFor this reason, specialized hardware is typically needed to accelerate the computations required by DNN.\nThe current state of hardware acceleration for deep learning is largely dominated by General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) due to the rich availability of software stacks to simplify their deployment on such platforms.\nWhen performing the computations required by DNNs, GPGPUs improve the performance of CPUs by orders of magnitude thanks to their greater ability in performing parallel computations. Due to the pervasive application and the effectiveness of DNNs, there is an increasing research and industrial interest in applying deep learning in the context of embedded systems. In this context, it is crucial to ensure a time-predictable and energy-efficient execution of the computations required by DNNs. Unfortunately, GPGPUs generally fail in matching these requirements.\nField Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) represent a very flexible alternative to GPGPUs for developing high-performance hardware acceleration. They generally provide better per-watt performance than GPGPUs, and are definitively more time-predictable. Indeed, they are considered a strong competitor of GPGPUs for deploying DNNs. On the other hand, programming FPGAs requires hardware-specific knowledge and they have been often considered platforms for specialists. However, during the last decade, several tools for adopting software-like programming models for FPGAs (e.g., high-level synthesis) became quite mature making FPGAs a more attractive choice for deploying DNNs.\nNevertheless, even with the availability of these tools, the acceleration of DNNs is particularly challenging due to the very complex computations they require. For this reason, several frameworks have been developed to help deploy DNNs on FPGAs. These frameworks generate hardware accelerators for DNNs that are extremely demanding in terms of FPGA resources and are often incompatible with platforms with small FPGA fabric. However, in most practical cases, system designers could need to deploy other hardware modules on FPGAs together with the ones required for DNNs acceleration, or need to dispose of DNNs acceleration on resource-constrained FPGAs (e.g., in small, low-cost embedded devices).\nContribution\nThis thesis addresses this issue by specifically considering DNNs accelerators for resource-constrained FPGAs. We leverage Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR), a prominent feature of modern FPGAs that allows reconfiguring at run-time a portion of their area while the rest of the modules deployed on other portions continue to operate. To handle DNNs accelerators under DPR, we propose a DNNs partitioning technique that allows deploying DNNs accelerators on FPGA fabrics in which they would not entirely fit. DNNs are decomposed in partitions that are cyclically programmed on the FPGA. DNNs partitions are also optimized to improve their timing performance. Specifically, this work performs a in-depth analysis of the DNNs runtime performance in the presence of partitioning and explores the trade-offs between FPGA area consumption and execution time when optimizing the DNNs partitioning", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04102019-140633", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1562748875000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262041000, "depositedDate": 1561590000000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Exploring time vs. area trade-offs in the deployment of Deep Neural Networks on reconfigurable FPGAs", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'INFORMAZIONE"], "types": [], "year": 2089, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/219640310", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04102019-140633/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04102019-140633", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "358980523", "authors": ["FARINA, DARIO"], "contributors": ["Filippeschi, Sauro", "Iorio, Carlo Saverio", "Dongo, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Patrice"], "datePublished": "2090-06-16T00:00:00", "description": "La tesi sperimentale \u00e8 stata svolta presso il Centro di ricerca di microgravit\u00e0 presso l'Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles.

The first two Chapters in this thesis describe the digitization procedure and related issues and some traditional computer vision methods for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Contrary to popular belief, conventional OCR systems remain a challenging problem in the world of text recognition, especially when the image-document has noisy behavior, diverse font, different contrast, and saturation, etc. In Chapter 3, to overcome information extraction issues, the development of a customized OCR model is presented. To obtain an efficient and high-quality approach, an implementation of a deep learning model, leveraging preprocessing and data augmentation, is described. the combination of the preprocessing and data augmentation with the cognitive solution as deep learning models is described. Deep learning has provided solutions to many pattern recognition problems. In the literature, various approaches have been implemented for OCR. But classic techniques always faces some drawbacks to overcome. Finally, a customized approach is defined to handle this issue. The final OCR model is robust and at the same time does not need human intervention for the preprocessing. Sequence-object detection becomes more reliable with this kind of model, as the model could be feed with different length of text within the image.

One way to automate this long task is to convert this process into\r\na real-time process with the automatic classification of the heart rate and with this, the\r\nclassification of arrhythmias.\r\nThus, this master thesis focuses on the study of Deep Learning models for the classification\r\nof arrhythmias and data processing tools for the streaming and processing of data in\r\nreal time. Consequently, this master\u2019s thesis comprises several phases. In the first place,\r\na more theoretical part is presented which is the ground truth of the use of the tools later\r\nused for the development of the system. The development of the system includes a\r\nmore practical part of data streaming composed by an IoT middleware, Apache Kafka as\r\nan intermediate agent between this middleware and Apache Spark, and ElasticSearch for\r\nreal-time data storage for visualization. On the other hand, in the main scope of this thesis,\r\ntwo models of Deep Learning were created, one for the classification of arrhythmias and\r\nanother one for their forecast.\r\nThe results obtained are promising with the arrhythmia classification yielding 98% accuracy\r\nin the classification of each beat in one of the four classes used. When the model\r\nwas tested in data obtained directly from the Hospital of Braga, it was not possible to obtain\r\nsuch good results, however, the model after new training was able to obtain accuracy\r\nvalues of 81% for the testing dataset. This deep learning model was also tested with the\r\nintegration of Apache Spark, in order to create data parallelism and increase the speed of\r\nthe deep learning process, which tends to be very time consuming, without neglecting its\r\nperformance.\r\nThe development of the model for the prediction of arrhythmias was done based on Long-\r\nShort Term Memory layers, in order to create a neural network with memory, the results\r\nobtained in the records with 30 minutes were not high. Despite the less good results in the\r\nfirst dataset, when the model was tested in the 24-hour records, the results obtained were\r\nquite high which demonstrated that the model can predict if it is based on a longer record.\r\nNevertheless, these results were obtained individually because the Electrocardiograms can\r\nbe an object of human identification.\r\nBased on the results obtained it was possible to conclude that more tests should be done\r\nincreasing the spectrum of arrhythmias to be classified so that this process becomes fully automatic, without neglecting the precision of the results since human lives may depend\r\non it.A monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o em tempo-real tem vindo a tornar-se numa das mais importantes e clinicamente\r\nrelevantes tarefas em ambientes m\u00e9dicos, todavia, uma das tarefas mais repetitivas\r\ne cansativas \u00e0 an\u00e1lise dos registos de Eletrocardiogramas de 24 horas. Uma das formas de\r\nautomatizar este longo processo \u00e9 convertendo este processo num processo em tempo-real\r\ncom a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o autom\u00e1tica do ritmo card\u00edaco e com isto a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de arritmias.\r\nDesta forma, o objetivo primordial desta tese de mestrado passa pelo estudo de modelos\r\nde Deep Learning para a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de arritmias assim como de ferramentas de\r\nprocessamento de dados para a transfer\u00eancia e processamento dos dados em tempo real.\r\nConsequentemente, esta tese de mestrado \u00e9 composta por v\u00e1rias fases. Em primeiro lugar\r\n\u00e9 apresentada uma parte mais te\u00f3rica que fundamenta a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das ferramentas posteriormente\r\nusadas para o desenvolvimento do sistema. O desenvolvimento do sistema\r\nengloba uma parte mais pr\u00e1tica de transmiss\u00e3o de dados composta por um middleware\r\nIoT, Apache Kafka como agente intermedi\u00e1rio entre este middleware e o Apache Spark e\r\nainda o ElasticSearch para armazenamento em tempo-real dos dados para visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos\r\nmesmos. Por outro lado, no \u00e2mbito principal desta tese, dois modelos de Deep Learning\r\nforam criados, um para a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de arritmias e outro para a previs\u00e3o destas.\r\nOs resultados conseguidos mostraram-se promissores, com a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de arritmias a\r\nobter resultados com precis\u00e3o de 98% na classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de cada batimento numa das quatro\r\nclasses usadas. Quando o modelo foi testado em dados obtidos diretamente do Hospital\r\nde Braga n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel obter diretamente bons resultados contudo ap\u00f3s novo treino\r\nconseguiu-se obter valores de precis\u00e3o de 81% para o dataset de teste. Este modelo de deep\r\nlearning foi tamb\u00e9m testado com a integra\u00e7\u00e3o do Apache Spark por forma a criar o paralelismo\r\nde dados e aumentar a rapidez do processo de deep learning, que tendencialmente \u00e9\r\nmuito moroso, sem descurar a performance do mesmo, ponto que foi conseguido.\r\nPor outro lado, o desenvolvimento do modelo para a previs\u00e3o de arritmias foi feito\r\ntendo por base camadas Long-Short Term Memory, de forma a criar uma rede neuronal\r\ncom mem\u00f3ria, os resultados obtidos nos registos com 30 minutos n\u00e3o foram muito altos\r\nainda assim foi poss\u00edvel concluir que os Eletrocardiogramas podem ser a base de estudos\r\nmais pormenorizados no sentido de serem considerados biomarcadores. Apesar dos resultados\r\nmenos bons no primeiro dataset, quando o modelo foi testado nos registos de 24\r\nhoras, os resultados obtidos foram bastante altos o que demonstrou que o modelo consegue\r\nprever caso tenha por base um registo mais longo. N\u00e3o obstante, estes resultados foram obtidos individualmente assentando no facto de que os Eletrocardiogramas s\u00e3o um objeto\r\nde identifica\u00e7\u00e3o humano.\r\nCom base nos resultados obtidos foi poss\u00edvel concluir que mais testes devem ser feitos\r\ntendo em conta o aumento do espetro de arritmias a serem classificadas de forma a que este\r\nprocesso se torne totalmente autom\u00e1tico, sem desprezar a precis\u00e3o dos resultados, uma vez\r\nque vidas humanas poder\u00e3o depender disso", "identifiers": ["oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/64179", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "18290", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Universidade do Minho: RepositoriUM", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1612603570000, "metadataUpdated": 1612603570000, "depositedDate": 1583229613000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis"], "title": "Cloud-based analytics for monitoring and classification of arrhythmias", "topics": ["Engenharia e Tecnologia::Engenharia M\u00e9dica"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/380774944", "http://hdl.handle.net/1822/64179"], "oai": "oai:repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt:1822/64179", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291799349", "authors": ["Zeng, Ziheng"], "contributors": ["Vasudevan, Shobha"], "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:39:04Z", "description": "From biology to sociology, network theory has been used as a tool for modeling the relationships among entities in complex systems. However, with the emergence of big data, applying the conventional network analysis algorithms, which are often combinatorial, to the contemporary networks is challenging due to the sheer size of the present day network data. On the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been exceptionally successful at learning from big data and achieved superhuman performance in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Hence, there is an opportunity to harness the power of DNNs for network analysis. Since DNNs require their inputs to be in the form of real-valued vectors, we need to use network embedding techniques to generate low-dimensional vectorized representations of the network that accurately encode the rich information and features that are relevant to the network analysis task. In this thesis, we present relation2vec, a contextualized network embedding method for heterogeneous information networks (HINs), in which there are more than one type of nodes and edges. Our method leverages the idea of meta-path, which allows a high-level abstraction of paths and denotes complex relationships among the nodes, to provide context for the nodes in the network, and then utilizes DNN, specifically, bi-directional long short-term memory, to encode the contextual information for each node, along with other rich information and heterogeneity, in the embeddings for both nodes and paths in HINs. We evaluate the performance of relation2vec across DBLP and Yelp datasets via four network analysis tasks: visualization, clustering purity test, node type prediction and path type prediction. The experiment results show that rela- tion2vec outperforms other state-of-the-art HIN embedding methods by 17% to 33% for average cluster purity and on average 0.36 for DBLP and 0.16 for Yelp in f-score for path type prediction. The performance of node type prediction is also competitive with the state of the art.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106491", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089650000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512143000, "depositedDate": 1585631059000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Relation2vec: Contextualized network embedding for heterogeneous information networks", "topics": ["heterogeneous information networks", "network embedding", "meta-path based", "graph representation learning"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291799349", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106491"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106491", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "232289823", "authors": ["Del Frari, Giovanni"], "contributors": ["Ferreira, Ricardo Boavida", "Oliveira, Helena"], "datePublished": "2022-09-01T00:00:00", "description": "Doutoramento em Biologia - Instituto Superior de Agronomia / ULThe \u2018esca disease complex\u2019 is a term used to identify several syndromes associated with a fungal infection of the wood of Vitis vinifera L. or other Vitis species.

Aim: To continue these previous studies, the authors wanted to determine whether the greater proportion of the unemployed Roma persons in the \u00d3zd microregion compared to the country average could contribute to the worse public health situation and the poor hygienic situation of the living environment of unemployed persons hardly or not suitable for learning. Method: Data from 400 unemployed Roma (96 males, 97 females) and caucasian non-Roma subjects (114 males, 93 females) obtained in 2012 and 2013 using self-completed and interview questionnaires were analysed. In addition, occupational medical examination methods were applied and the results were analysed. Results: It was found that all studied parameters (public health and epidemiological safety, in-door living environmental hygiene, conditions for learning) indicated significantly disadvantaged situation of the Roma compared to the non-Roma unemployed persons. There was a clear relationship between these examined parameters and other factors adversely influencing the quality of life of Roma persons (unemployment, deep poverty, lower level of education, shorter life span). Finally, the results showed that the quality of life conditions of the lowest 1/10, 1/5 of the non-Roma unemployed persons were comparable to those found in the average of Roma unemployed persons. Conclusions: The authors conclude that i) the greater proportion of unemployed Roma persons in the Ozd microregion contributes to the worse public health, epidemiological safety and the worse living conditions of unemployed persons in this regions of the country; ii) It would be essential to provide Roma persons with conditions appropriate for learning, which could enable them to get qualification necessary for employment.

With the fast-growing volume of and interest in spatio-temporal mobility data, there is also an increasing need for new methods of analyzing this kind of data. Particularly, considerable effort has been made to characterize human activity-travel patterns from the spatio-temporal mobility data. However, knowledge discovery from the large-scale human mobility data remains a challenging task due to its complex spatio-temporal variations. Most traditional statistical and machine learning techniques are powerful for prediction tasks but are not tailored to characterize the dynamical spatio-temporal correlations in the human mobility data. This dissertation offers several methodological and practical contributions to the field through developing a set of novel methods and validation with real-world use cases. First, a locally adaptive space-time kernel approach is proposed to model the non-emergency municipal services demand in Chicago. Second, this work develops novel sequential similarity measures for analyzing human activity-travel patterns and Bayesian networks models with specially designed topology to predict the forthcoming activity at the individual level. Last, a deep convolutional LSTM networks model is proposed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in an integrated way to predict real-time taxi demand. All proposed models are proven to be more effective or robust in various real-world experiments as compared to traditional statistical or machine learning algorithms but are not limited to these use cases. The methods contribute to any point demand modeling, regional demand modeling, and sequential trajectory learning problems for spatio-temporal data.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106442", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1583963570000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571448000, "depositedDate": 1583188751000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Advanced space-time integration for knowledge discovery in human mobility studies", "topics": ["Space-time modeling", "Mobility", "Space-time kernel", "Sequential pattern mining", "Bayesian networks", "Demand modeling", "Deep learning", "LSTM"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/287625033", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106442"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/106442", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "328785643", "authors": ["Hoskere, Vedhus A"], "contributors": ["Lazebnik, Svetlana"], "datePublished": "2022-08-26T23:58:55", "description": "Manual visual inspection is the most common means of assessing the condition of civil infrastructure in the United States but can be exceedingly laborious, time consuming, and dangerous. Research has focused on automating parts of the inspection process using unmanned aerial vehicles for image acquisition, followed by deep learning techniques for damage identification. Existing deep learning methods and datasets for inspections have typically been developed for a single damage type. However, most guidelines for inspections require the identification of multiple damage types and describe evaluating the significance of the damage based on the associated material type. Thus, the identification of material type is important in understanding the meaning of the identified damage. Training separate networks for the tasks of material and damage identification fails to incorporate this intrinsic interdependence between them. We hypothesize that a network that incorporates such interdependence directly will have a better accuracy in material and damage identification. To this end, a deep neural network, termed the Material-and-Damage-Network (MaDnet), is proposed to simultaneously identify material type (concrete, steel, asphalt), as well as fine (cracks, exposed rebar) and coarse (spalling, corrosion) structural damage. In this approach, semantic segmentation (i.e., assignment of each pixel in the image with a material and damage label) is employed, where the interdependence between material and damage is incorporated through shared filters learned through multi-objective optimization. A new dataset with pixel-level labels identifying the material and damage type is developed and made available to the research community. Finally, the dataset is used to evaluate MaDnet and demonstrate the improvement in pixel-accuracy over employing independent networks.U of I OnlyAuthor requested U of Illinois access only (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108191", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1599185967000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571491000, "depositedDate": 1598482763000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Multi-task semantic segmentation of damage and materials for visual inspection of civil infrastructure", "topics": ["multi-task learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, damage identification, visual inspection"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/328785643", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/108191"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108191", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "334980016", "authors": ["Chen, Wei"], "contributors": ["Ferguson, Andrew L", "Kuehn, Seppe", "Cooper, Lance", "Shukla, Diwakar"], "datePublished": "2022-10-07T22:50:13", "description": "Machine learning has been playing an increasingly important role in many \ufb01elds of computational physics, including molecular simulation. In this thesis, I report my work on machine learning method developments for molecular simulation, and their applications on learning conformations and kinetics for molecular systems. First, I present a deep-learning based accelerated sampling framework termed \u201cMolecular Enhanced Sampling with Autoencoders\u201d (MESA) that utilizes high-variance collective variables (CVs) to guide sampling. By applying the framework on some molecular systems, I show its efficiency for exploring con\ufb01guration space, and discuss several aspects for improvements. Second, I build a deep-learning based model termed \u201cState-free Reversible VAMPnets\u201d (SRVs) to learn slow CVs that govern the dominant kinetics of the system. By comparing SRVs with the existing kernel based method, I show that SRVs are more accurate, less sensitive to feature selection and feature scaling, and more computationally efficient. Also, extensive mathematical analysis provides theoretical guarantees for the correctness of the SRV model. Combined with Markov state models (MSMs), I show that CVs discovered by SRVs serve as excellent basis for constructing MSMs that enables high-resolution kinetics analysis, which opens the door to applications for many important physical processes. In sum, this thesis establishes new machine learning methods for learning molecular conformations, kinetics and other physical properties, builds connections between theoretical developments and computational applications, and provides new insights for both machine learning and computational physics communities.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108655", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1602815291000, "metadataUpdated": 1607571500000, "depositedDate": 1602306521000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "title": "Machine learning of molecular conformations, kinetics and beyond", "topics": ["machine learning", "molecular simulation", "deep learning", "autoencoders", "enhanced sampling"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/334980016", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/108655"], "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/108655", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "84367279", "authors": ["RESASCO, DANIELA"], "contributors": ["Bicchi, Antonio"], "datePublished": "2087-05-04T00:00:00", "description": "The goal of this thesis is have a robot that learn how to grasp an unknown object with an underactuated end-effector.

Automated image analysis can extract meaningful information from raw images and generate novel insight, having superiority in processing efficiency and assessment objectivity over manual image analysis. Since many image analysis tasks can be essentially viewed as problems of feature mapping, feature extraction plays a pivotal role in automated image analysis. Feature extraction methods can be generally divided into hand-crafted methods and deep learning methods. Hand-crafted methods have comparatively better interpretability, and their processing procedures can be well controlled by explicitly defined parameters. Representative hand-crafted features include edges, lines, and blobs. Deep learning methods have a powerful ability to learn and represent features, and thus, they can accomplish comparatively more complex tasks. Hand-crafted methods and deep learning methods are not mutually exclusive. Many deep learning methods have greatly benefited from hand-crafted features. Therefore, it is still necessary to further explore the potential of hand-crafted features to have more explicit toolkits, and to provide more explanations for deep learning techniques. Moreover, it would be worth developing methods that jointly exploit the advantages of hand-crafted methods and deep learning methods.\nIn bioscience engineering, although a large amount of image analysis methods have been developed, there are still many particular tasks that remain unsolved. In aquaculture, the brine shrimp Artemia is a widely used cost-effective diet for fish and crustaceans, and recently, the number of Artemia studies is increasing. Since Artemia objects are very small in size, they are usually observed by a stereo-microscope, which can acquire a large amount of Artemia images containing many Artemia objects. Conventionally, most of the Artemia image analysis tasks are carried out manually, which is rather time-consuming and labor-intensive. Hence, it is quite necessary to design tailor-made methods for analyzing Artemia images.  \nIn this thesis, on the one hand, we investigate several Gaussian-based convolutional kernels to extract hand-crafted features. We present the normalized first-order derivative of anisotropic Gaussian kernel that can detect multiscale edges with a good noise-robustness. This kernel is applied to contour detection and superpixel segmentation. Also, we develop a line detection method using the normalized and adaptive second-order anisotropic Gaussian kernel. This method can effectively detect multiscale lines in a noisy environment. For blob characterization, we propose the unilateral second-order Gaussian kernel that can quantitatively measure the blob prominence, scale, and position, while yielding little response for non-blob structures. The favorable properties of this kernel are confirmed in image denoising. Moreover, we propose a blob detection method using iterative Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering and the unilateral second-order Gaussian kernel. This method can handle overlapping blobs effectively. On the other hand, aiming at automated Artemia image analysis, we propose an Artemia detection and counting method using U-shaped fully convolutional networks and deep convolutional networks. Besides, by jointly using deep learning techniques and hand-crafted features, we develop an automated method that can measure the Artemia length accurately in images. All the proposed methods are validated on either widely adopted datasets or in-house datasets", "identifiers": ["oai:archive.ugent.be:8635328", null], "publisher": "Ghent University.

Using information from external sources requires establishing correspondences between the information and known information classes. This can be achieved with semantic labelling, which assigns known labels to structured information by classifying it according to computed features. The existing proposals have explored different sets of features, without focusing on what classification techniques are used. In this paper we present three contributions: first, insights on architectural issues that arise when using neural networks for semantic labelling; second, a novel implementation of semantic labelling that uses a state-of-the-art neural network classifier which achieves significantly better results than other four traditional classifiers; third, a comparison of the results obtained by the former network when using different subsets of features, comparing textual features to structural ones, and domain-dependent features to domain-independent ones. The experiments were carried away with datasets from three real world sources.

The use of the electrocardiogram (ECG) in horses is still limited to rhythm and rate diagnosis whereas identification of the underlying mechanisms of arrhythmias often requires invasive electrophysiological studies that have not fully been developed in horses. Meanwhile, in human medicine the 12-lead ECG has been a cornerstone in the development of human cardiology. Next to the diagnosis of arrhythmias, it also allows recognition of structural cardiac abnormalities, conduction disturbances, genetically mediated electrical abnormalities, myocardial infarction and electrolyte disturbances. Additionally, advanced invasive techniques have been developed in humans for both the identification of the underlying mechanisms of arrhythmias and treatment of arrhythmias. Equine cardiology has not followed this evolution largely because knowledge from human and small animal cardiology cannot be directly extrapolated to horses due to their different conduction system. For a long time, it was believed that only a part of the depolarization of the equine heart was visible on the surface ECG and that, hence, the surface ECG was only of limited use. \nThe General introduction discusses the current knowledge about human and especially equine ECG. First the genesis and nomenclature of the electrocardiogram in horses is briefly discussed. Next, an overview is given of the development of ECG in humans with extra emphasis on the 12-lead ECG and vectorcardiography (VCG). Subsequently, the anatomical and physiological differences between the human and equine heart are discussed. These are followed by the development of equine ECG and some common lead systems that have been used in horses. Subsequently, equine ECG characteristics and analysis are described. This section starts with the description of the most commonly occurring arrhythmias, their underlying pathophysiology and their appearance on the surface ECG. Thereafter, manual analyses of the equine ECG are described followed by a description of automated analyses of the human ECG. Finally, a short overview is given of invasive cardiac electrophysiological techniques in humans and horses.\nThe first major objective of this dissertation was to improve the screening and diagnosis of arrhythmias in horses using the modified base-apex bipolar surface ECG recording. Therefore, we explored the use of deep learning for the semi-automated analysis of equine ECGs in Chapter 1 and evaluated the use of the atrial fibrillatory rate (AFR) derived from a surface ECG in Chapter 2. The second major objective was to develop a new invasive method for identifying the origin of cardiac arrhythmias: 3D electro-anatomical mapping. Therefore, the development and methodology of the technique in horses is described in Chapter 3, and the normal depolarization pattern of the heart in sinus rhythm (SR) using this 3D electro-anatomical mapping technique is described in Chapter 4. The third major objective of this study was to evaluate if multiple lead recordings, i.e. the 12-lead ECG and vectorcardiography, have additional value for equine cardiology if adapted to equine physiology. Therefore, we explored the use of 12-lead ECG and VCG for the determination of the site of origin for atrial and ventricular premature depolarizations in Chapter 5.\nChapter 1 describes the development of a complete algorithm for equine specific ECG analysis. Both the initial filtering and QRS beat detection were done with wavelet transformations. The QRS detection algorithm outperformed the classic Pan-Tompkins algorithm with a sensitivity of 99.0% versus 91.5% for the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. Next, a novel parallel convolutional neural network architecture was proposed for the feature extraction and classification of the individual beats. The novelty of this network architecture is the parallel processing of both the morphological data from the ECG deflections and the relative timing to the other beats in the ECG. Because no public datasets are available for equine ECGs, a dataset was made with 26.440 beats in 4 classes: normal, ventricular and atrial premature depolarization and noise. The network was then trained and tested using both the human MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset and the own-made equine ECG dataset. The network was optimized using a genetic algorithm and an accuracy of 97.7% and 92.6% was achieved for the MIT-BIH and equine ECG database, respectively. Afterwards, transfer learning from the MIT-BIH dataset to the equine ECG database was applied after which the average accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value and F1 score of the network increased with an accuracy of 97.1%.\nIn Chapter 2 the AFR derived from a single-lead surface ECG was compared with the atrial fibrillation rate derived from a right atrial intracardiac recording (RA-FR). Three minute long episodes of simultaneous electrograms and surface ECG during atrial fibrillation (AF) were selected for analysis and compared using Bland-Altman test. The mean RA-FR was measured from the deflections on the intracardiac electrogram, while the AFR was extracted from the surface ECG using spatiotemporal QRS and T-wave cancellation. In addition, we evaluated the correlation of AFR with transvenous electrical cardioversion (TVEC) threshold (in Joules), number of shocks and cardioversion success rate in horses. This was done in 73 horses treated for atrial fibrillation by TVEC. The mean difference between RA-FR and AFR was -13 fibrillations per minute and there was a moderate (r=0.65) correlation between RA-FR and AFR. Neither RA-FR nor AFR showed a significant correlation with transvenous electrical cardioversion threshold, number of shocks or cardioversion success. We concluded that the AFR may allow non-invasive long-term monitoring of AF dynamics and that neither RA-FR nor AFR can be used to predict the minimal defibrillation threshold.\nThe methodology for 3D ultra-high-density electro-anatomical mapping is described in Chapter 3. Ultra-high-density cardiac mapping allowed very accurate characterization of atrial and ventricular electrophysiology and activation timing. Electro-anatomical maps were acquired from all 4 chambers in four horses in SR under general anaesthesia. All endocardial areas within each chamber could be reached with the basket catheter of the mapping system, but access to the left atrium required the use of a deflectable sheath. With the exception of the left atrial map of 1 horse, all four chambers in all four horses could be mapped. The mapping system uses beat acceptance criteria for the automatic acquisition of endocardial electrograms. Optimization of the beat acceptance criteria led to a reduction in manual correction of the automatically accepted beats from 13.1% in the first horse to 0.4% of the beats in the last horse. The study shows that 3D electro-anatomical mapping is feasible in adult horses and that it is a promising tool for electrophysiological research and characterization of complex arrhythmias.\nThe first electrophysiological research performed with the 3D electro-anatomical mapping system in horses is described in Chapter 4. The system was used to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative depolarization patterns and correlation to the surface ECG of both the atrial and ventricular endocardium in 7 healthy horses in sinus rhythm under general anaesthesia. This was done by analysing the bipolar activation maps of the endocardium. The first atrial activation was located at the height of the terminal crest. Only one interatrial conduction pathway was recognized. The first and second P wave deflections represented the right and left atrial depolarization, respectively. Bundle of His electrograms could be recorded in 5 out of 7 horses. Left ventricular activation started at the mid septum and right ventricular activation started apically from the supraventricular crest. This was followed by separate depolarizations at the height of the right and left ventricular mid free wall. Further ventricular depolarization occurred in an explosive pattern. The results of this study are a reference for the normal sinus impulse propagation pattern and for the conduction velocities in equine atria and ventricles. Even more importantly, these results show that all parts of the atrial and ventricular depolarization contribute to the surface ECG\u2019s P wave and QRS complex. Thus, the surface ECG does contain information about the entire depolarization of the heart, in contrast to findings of previous studies.\nThe next goal was to evaluate whether VCG characteristics can differentiate between anatomical locations of atrial (APDs) and ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) as well as between SR and APDs (Chapter 5). In 7 horses a 12-lead ECG was recorded under general anaesthesia while endomyocardial pacing was performed (800-1000 ms cycle length) in the atria at the pulmonary veins, left atrial free wall and septum, right atrial free wall, intervenous tubercle, as well as the cranial and caudal junction with vena cava. Endomyocardial pacing was performed in the ventricles at the apex, mid and high septum and mid and high free wall, and at the right ventricular outflow tract. Catheter positioning was guided by 3D electro-anatomical mapping and transthoracic ultrasound. The VCG was calculated from the 12-lead ECG using custom-made algorithms and was used to determine the mean electrical axis of the first and second half of the P wave and the initial and mean electrical axis of the QRS complex. A significant differentiation could be made between the site of origin of every paced APD. SR could be differentiated from all paced APDs except those originating from the cranial junction with vena cava. For the ventricles a significant differentiation was possible between left and right ventricular paced complexes. Within the left ventricle, paced complexes from all locations showed significant differences. Within the right ventricle, only paced complexes originating from the right ventricular outflow tract were significantly different from all other paced beats. Paced complexes originating from other locations within the right ventricle only showed significant differences compared to locations not adjacent to the paced location. Paced complexes originating from the right ventricular mid septum and the left ventricular apex were not significantly different from sinus rhythm. These results suggest that VCG, and in extension multiple lead recordings, could be useful to identify the anatomical origin of atrial and ventricular ectopy in horses. However, differentiation of the site of origin within the right ventricle is challenging.\nAs a general conclusion this work shows that equine ECGs have more clinical applications than currently employed and especially multiple lead recordings are underused at the moment. The results and methods described in this thesis can be a starting point for future investigations into equine electrocardiography. The algorithm for semi-automated analysis of equine ECGs could be used to improve screening for arrythmias in the general horse population. The atrial fibrillation rate derived from the surface ECG allows to better understand the underlying pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. Finally, 3D electro-anatomical mapping and multiple lead recordings can be used to determine the underlying origin of arrhythmias and guide their targeted treatment", "identifiers": ["oai:archive.ugent.be:8667065", null], "publisher": "Universiteit Gent.

The study used a longitudinal qualitative approach comprising twenty-two semi-structured interviews with eleven Portuguese consumers. The research was conducted in two moments in time: 2014 and 2018, corresponding to periods of Portuguese recession and recovery. The results show that, during recessions, consumers look for economic level-headedness, adopting and assuming new behaviors that allow them to accommodate the reduced income, which also translates into increased social responsibility. Besides switching to cheaper options, namely looking for private labels and national brand promotions, consumers revealed new strategies and new habits, such as i) more organization and planned behavior; ii) going shopping more frequently; iii) reducing stocking behavior, and iv) avoiding wasting. The study expands the comprehension of consumer behavior during recessions and recovery, bringing the idea of crises as \u2018learning journeys\u2019 and transformational opportunities.authorsversionpublishe", "identifiers": ["oai:run.unl.pt:10362/93868", "10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.04.021"], "journals": [{"title": "Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services", "identifiers": ["0969-6989", "issn:0969-6989"]}], "language": {"code": "en", "id": 9, "name": "English"}, "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "1958", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Reposit\u00f3rio da Universidade Nova de Lisboa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1585742217000, "metadataUpdated": 1610287776000, "depositedDate": 1585351899000}, "subjects": ["article"], "title": "a learning journey", "topics": ["Consumer behavior", "Consumption", "Economic crisis", "Longitudinal", "Recession", "Recovery", "Marketing"], "types": [], "year": 2022, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288869215.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/288869215", "http://hdl.handle.net/10362/93868", "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.04.021"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/288869215.pdf", "doi": "10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.04.021", "oai": "oai:run.unl.pt:10362/93868", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/288869215.pdf"}, {"id": "344893985", "authors": ["Beteg\u00f3n Garc\u00eda, Miguel"], "contributors": ["S\u00e1nchez Espeso, Pablo Pedro", "Universidad de Cantabria"], "datePublished": "2025-07-27T00:00:00", "description": "RESUMEN: Siendo una rama del aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico, el aprendizaje profundo ha conseguido resolver problemas que hasta hace unos a\u00f1os resultaban muy dif\u00edciles o incluso imposibles para la visi\u00f3n artificial tradicional, superando as\u00ed los l\u00edmites del procesamiento digital de im\u00e1genes.

Nowadays, computer vision oriented deep learning models draw upon convolutional artificial neural networks, which allow the development of object classification, detection, location and segmentation systems. In order to accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to obtain a dataset large enough for the models to be able to learn from the data. This learning of data is precisely the paradigm shift that has made machine learning to succeed. Using the advantages offered by deep learning, this work reflects the development of a computer vision system capable of detecting personal protective equipment and which can be integrated in a commercial solution. To this end, the necessary theory about machine learning and computer vision is first analyzed, as well as deep learning, which allows choosing the best possible option to attack the problem posed. Finally and after development, the results obtained following the deployment in a real use case are contemplated, verifying its correct operation. The scope of deep learning in the field of artificial vision once this works has finished, is clarified.M\u00e1ster en Ingenier\u00eda de Telecomunicaci\u00f3", "identifiers": ["oai:repositorio.unican.es:10902/19024", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2259", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "UCrea", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1606185004000, "metadataUpdated": 1611614735000, "depositedDate": 1596495693000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis"], "title": "Deep learning vision system to verify the security of technical equipment", "topics": ["Aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico", "Aprendizaje profundo", "Redes neuronales artificiales", "Redes neuronales convolucionales", "Visi\u00f3n artificial", "Detecci\u00f3n de objetos", "Conjunto de datos", "Equipos de protecci\u00f3n individual", "Machine learning", "Deep learning", "Artificial neural networks", "Convolutional neural networks", "Computer vision", "Object detection", "Dataset", "Personal protection equipment"], "types": [], "year": 2025, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/344893985", "http://hdl.handle.net/10902/19024"], "oai": "oai:repositorio.unican.es:10902/19024", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "225316428", "authors": ["Mart\u00edn Dur\u00e1ntez, Noelia"], "contributors": ["Aguado Tirado, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas", "Universidad de Cantabria"], "datePublished": "2024-06-06T00:00:00", "description": "RESUMEN: La etapa de la adolescencia est\u00e1 marcada por r\u00e1pidos cambios f\u00edsicos y relacionales, siendo la sexualidad uno de los aspectos m\u00e1s vulnerables ya que, a las caracter\u00edsticas propias de la poblaci\u00f3n adolescente como la baja percepci\u00f3n de riesgos, se a\u00f1aden en nuestro entorno una evoluci\u00f3n de las actitudes y pr\u00e1cticas sexuales, un inicio m\u00e1s temprano de la pubertad y una desigual intervenci\u00f3n desde los \u00e1mbitos familiar, escolar y sanitario.\n\nLa familia desarrolla la funci\u00f3n m\u00e1s esencial en la transmisi\u00f3n de actitudes, habilidades y comportamientos sexualmente saludables, por lo que su intervenci\u00f3n es recomendable y necesaria para afrontar durante la adolescencia la vida sexual con responsabilidad.\n\nSin embargo, es escasa investigaci\u00f3n cualitativa en nuestro medio sobre las estrategias familiares en la educaci\u00f3n afectivo-sexual de adolescentes.\n\nEl principal objetivo de este trabajo es, explorar la educaci\u00f3n afectivo-sexual que reciben los/as adolescentes en el seno familiar con respecto a las relaciones humanas, los v\u00ednculos amorosos y las pr\u00e1cticas sexuales.\n\nSe ha planteado el trabajo desde el paradigma cualitativo, con una perspectiva fenomenol\u00f3gica por ser la metodolog\u00eda m\u00e1s apropiada para la comprensi\u00f3n profunda de los escenarios familiares y su papel en el proceso de ense\u00f1anza-aprendizaje de la esfera afectivo-sexual.\n\nLos participantes ser\u00e1n padres, madres, hijos/hijas, y enfermeras de atenci\u00f3n primaria, que ser\u00e1n captadas durante el contacto de la investigadora con el centro escolar y durante la atenci\u00f3n sanitaria prestada en el centro de salud de atenci\u00f3n primaria.

Sexuality is one of the most vulnerable aspects for adolescents. This is in due part to the low risks perceived by them. Adding to that the evolution of sexual attitudes and practises in the environment, the puberty phase is starting sooner; and with scarce guidance from home, school or health specialists.\n\nThe environment at home is the most essential to instil healthy sexual attitudes, abilities and behaviours. In that respect it\u00b4s intervention is both necessary and desirable to confront a responsible sex life during puberty.\n\nNone the less, there is little quality investigation in our environment about family strategies on sexual-affection education of teenagers.\n\nThe main objective of this dissertation is to explore the sexual-affection education that the youth is receiving at home and it\u00b4s relation with interpersonal relationships, love life and sexual practices.\n\nThis work was conceptualised from the quality paradigm, with a phenomenological perspective; for it is the most appropriate for the deep understanding of family roles, and their part on teaching-learning process inside the sexual-affection environment.\n\nThe participants will be parents, sons, daughters and primary care nurses. The recruitment will happen while the researcher is in contact with the school and while medical attention is being given at primary health care centres\n\nThis will be completed by a deliberate and intentional theoretical sampling, that will compile the data through observational, conversational and documentation skills; ending once the theoretical saturation is achieved.\n\nData analysis will be integrated in the data collection, and it will be based on the thematic content analysis.\n\nUnderstanding this phenomenon will be useful to plan future interventions, from the healthcare point of view, of sexual-affection education programs that will include the needs voiced by families and teenagers.M\u00e1ster en Investigaci\u00f3n en Cuidados de Salu", "identifiers": ["oai:repositorio.unican.es:10902/16538", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2259", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "UCrea", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1567526990000, "metadataUpdated": 1611614715000, "depositedDate": 1563490845000}, "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis"], "title": "The challenge of sex education from the family: a qualitative approach", "topics": ["Adolescente", "Familia", "Educaci\u00f3n sexual", "Sexualidad", "Comunicaci\u00f3n", "Adolescent", "Family", "Sex education", "Sexuality", "Communication"], "types": [], "year": 2024, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/225316428", "http://hdl.handle.net/10902/16538"], "oai": "oai:repositorio.unican.es:10902/16538", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "328874273", "authors": ["Bola\u00f1os Sol\u00e0, Marc", "Verdaguer, Eric", "Radeva, Petia"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "2025-07-30T00:00:00", "description": "Requeriments t\u00e8cnics: Ordinador que disposi de GPU Nvidia i Llibreries docker i docker-compose instalades al sistema.L'acc\u00e9s al manual i al codi no estar\u00e0 disponible fins la fi de la data d'embargament.

At first, it is proposed a Deep Learning solution to the Transaction Categorization problem, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Each transaction contains enough information to allow for an efficient categorization. State-of-the-art technologies and methods of Natural Language Processing (NLP) were used in order to classify clients\u2019 transactions in 7 different spending areas. The CNN model proposed is able to classify with very high accuracy the transactions in the pre-defined areas. Transaction Categorization provides a useful insight to understand where clients spend their money, what are their needs and habits, and what possible banking services/products could be worth to them, thus offering the possibility to create a personalized experience to each customer.\nIn the second part, techniques of clustering and similarity in vector space were used in order to associate items to the users based on their interests, which were analysed by getting statistics from the history of their past categorized transactions. Similar users were grouped in clusters using the K-means algorithm in order to set the path for a collaborative-filtering RS, where the behaviour of a user within the cluster would help to recommend similar users the same services", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-11202019-110832", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1577284245000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262061000, "depositedDate": 1576454400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "A Recommendation System for Personal Financial Management via Deep Learning-based Categorization", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'INFORMAZIONE"], "types": [], "year": 2089, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/275653540", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-11202019-110832/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-11202019-110832", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "358980734", "authors": ["VITELLI, FEDERICA"], "contributors": ["Fattori, Bruno", "Nacci, Andrea"], "datePublished": "2090-11-17T00:00:00", "description": "Background.

Nevertheless, if a model is trained for a specific set of cameras it is hard to make it work properly on cameras with different viewing conditions, i.e. to make the model general and not strongly dependent from the context. In this study, different models at the state-of-the-art were analyzed, and two of them were implemented for testing their generalization ability - Vehicle ReID Baseline and Deep Meta Metric Learning (DMML). Both Vehicle ReID Baseline and DMML employ a particular type of convolutional neural network, the ResNet-50, that is the backbone of the model. The neural network was trained on the VeRi dataset. The generalization ability of the models was tested on VehicleID dataset", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-06072020-160831", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1611262075000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262075000, "depositedDate": 1609977600000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Generalization Capabilities of Deep Learning Architectures for Vehicle Re-Identification", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'INFORMAZIONE"], "types": [], "year": 2023, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/372703889", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-06072020-160831/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-06072020-160831", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "160011965", "authors": ["ZUMBO, LORENA MARIA"], "contributors": ["Landini, Luigi", "Della Latta, Daniele", "Santini, Gianmarco", "Martini, Nicola", "Chiappino, Dante"], "datePublished": "2088-05-03T00:00:00", "description": "Nella popolazione europea, il 20% delle scansioni tomografiche (CT) riguardano la zona toracica.

The pontine noradrenergic nucleus Locus Coeruleus (LC) has long been known to degenerate early in AD. This may contribute to the mechanisms involved in amyloid and Tau pathology, favoring, for example, neuroinflammation. Furthermore, it might predispose also to epileptic activity, which, apart from being an epiphenomenon frequently observed in AD, might also concur to AD physiopathology. Hence, studying LC function and morphology in vivo may have important pathophysiological, diagnostic, and, in perspective, therapeutic implications. However, this goal is complicated by LC small dimensions, its deep positioning and widespread connections. To get around these difficulties, LC structural evaluation is often performed through LC-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a validated technique for this purpose. Pupil diameter, as measured by pupillometry, has been shown to be associated with LC activity in animal models and humans, through MRI.\nObjective: Thus, building on the results of LC structural and functional evaluation obtained, respectively, on elderly and young test populations, the present study aims at developing a protocol for LC morphological and functional evaluation in elderly subjects and AD patients.\nMethods: To this end, we enrolled 26 healthy young volunteers (age range: 21\u201329 years, 12 females) and 54 cognitively healthy elderly volunteers (60\u201380 years, 33 females). Both groups completed neuropsychological tests evaluating, among others, attention and memory, e.g. digit span recall and delayed Rey auditory verbal learning tests. Elderly subjects underwent neuromelanin-sensitive MRI. Young volunteers underwent functional LC assessment, including EEG and pupillometry recording during execution of LC-activating tasks, such as a three-stimuli auditory oddball task.\nResults: In elderly subjects, we found a positive correlation between LC volume and score at the digit span recall test (p= 0.039, Pearson\u2019s r= 0.313), while a negative correlation was observed between LC average intensity and score at the delayed Rey auditory verbal learning test (p= 0.016, Pearson\u2019s r = -0.362). No correlation was found between subjects\u2019 age and LC MRI data. In young volunteers, the protocol for functional LC evaluation was successfully performed, the target stimulus during the oddball task effectively activated the LC, as measured by pupil dilation (p<0.05), and we found a negative correlation between amplitude of the EEG component P3b and pupil diameter change in response to the target stimulus during the auditory oddball. These results confirmed the feasibility of our protocol for functional LC evaluation and allowed us to design a similar protocol suitable for elderly subjects and AD patients. This protocol is a shorter and simpler version of the one we used in young volunteers, designed with the aim of acquiring maximal information with minimal effort for the subject. It accounts for the possibility of screening for EEG epileptic abnormalities, which will be crucial once the protocol is applied to AD patients.\nConclusions: Thus, we characterized the LC from a structural and functional viewpoint in elderly and young volunteers, respectively. This allowed us to design a protocol for functional LC evaluation in elderly subjects and AD patients. Experimental sessions for functional LC evaluation in the elderly volunteers, who underwent LC-sensitive MRI, are now postponed due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, once we will have collected LC functional data from these subjects, we will be able to correlate them with the existing MRI data on LC structure, thus validating a protocol for LC structural and functional evaluation in elderly subjects, which will be of great interest for AD patients", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-05222020-153821", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1599221884000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262075000, "depositedDate": 1595631600000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Structural and functional evaluation of the Locus Coeruleus in young and elderly subjects: validation of a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease", "topics": ["RICERCA TRASLAZIONALE E DELLE NUOVE TECNOLOGIE IN MEDICINA E CHIRURGIA"], "types": [], "year": 2090, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/328847779", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-05222020-153821/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-05222020-153821", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "219640312", "authors": ["RAPUANO, EMILIO"], "contributors": ["Fanucci, Luca", "Dinelli, Gianmarco", "Meoni, Gabriele"], "datePublished": "2089-05-03T00:00:00", "description": "During the last years, Convolutional Neural Networks have been used for different applications thanks to their potentiality to carry out tasks by using a reduced number of parameters if compared to other Deep Learning approaches.

For such reason, commercial hardware accelerators have become popular, thanks to their architecture designed for the inference of general Convolutional Neural Networks models.\nNevertheless, Field Programmable Gate Arrays represent an interesting perspective, since they offer the possibility of implement a hardware architecture tailored to a specific Convolutional Neural Network model, with promising results in terms of power consumption and timing performances.\nIn this thesis, we propose a Field Programmable Gate Array hardware accelerator for a Separable Convolutional Neural Network, which was designed for a Keyword Spotting application.

For our goals, we appropriately quantized such model through a bit-true simulation, and we realized a dedicated architecture.\nA benchmark comparing the results on different Field Programmable Gate Arrays families by Xilinx with the implementation on Neural Computer Stick was realized.

It proposes an overview of the technology and the medical applications of these systems, with a focus on the advantages of intraoperative systems and, in particular, the added progress of having an automatic retinal layers' segmentation algorithm. It has been proved in these last years, that Deep Learning can deal efficiently computer vision tasks and there are examples in literature on using these recent methods to segment retinal layer on diagnostic OCT scans. In this thesis, it is presented a recap of the most recent and successful between these approaches and the technical ideas behind them. However, to the knowledge of the author, there are no segmentation algorithms applied to intraoperative systems. This study presents a model, specifically used for edge detection, in order to find two retinal layers, Inner Limiting Layer (ILM) and Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE), in intraoperative OCT B-scans. The task of segmenting retinal layers in intraoperative OCT scans is more challenging due to the noisy and (sometimes) unreliable nature of the images. Moreover, it is also presented an extension of the model with an adversarial extension, to avoid specific issues of the task and improve the outcome.

After brefly introducing the concept of assistive technology and who uses it, we present some of the most important socio-economic aspects of the assistive technology scenario and why R\\&D in universities and public research centers are so important in this field, more than in others.\nThe main objectives of the work is to show the current researches in Assistive Technology field carried out by the candidate. In the following chapters these research topics will be discussed:\n- In chapter 2 we explore the design of audio algorithms, hardware IP and devices for people with hearing losses. Our systems exploit microphone arrays to enhance acquired audio by using advanced state of the art audio algorithms like beamforming and noise reduction. Also a lot of effort was devoted to build these systems with minimal power consumption.\n- In chapter 3 it is shown the design of a wheelchair mounted robotic arm addressed for people with motor skill impairments, the project RIMEDIO. We build a fully autonomous robotic arm that can perform simple tasks like knocking a door, press an elevator button, switch on/off the light and similar tasks.\n- In chapter 4 we explore a state of the art algorithm for 3D scene reconstruction. The proposed scene reconstruction pipeline is capable of automatically reconstruct full 3D views of the environment even with a single viewpoint by inferring similarities in geometries and shapes between known objects. This system can be a base building block for fully autonomous robotic manipulators.\n- In chapter 5 it is described a wearable intelligent computer vision system intended for visually impaired users. The system is designed to recognize the objects within the images and it currently supports TensorFlow, a deep learning software framework released by Google, and it is especially designed for pattern recognition activities.\n- Finally, in chapter 6 we present a wearable devices specifically tailored for people with neurogenic bladder. Patients with impaired bladder volume sensation have the necessity to monitor bladder level in order to avoid urinary tract infections and urinary reflux that can lead to renal failure. Our wearable solution uses bioimpedance measurement to monitor bladder volume level. Adaptive intelligent algorithms can improve performance and accuracy of our system.\nEach chapter introduces a real world problem that was brought to our attention by the users. We apply state of the art technologies and methodologies from engineering and computer science to solve it. Stakeholders as clinicians, research centers, devices manufacturers, IT multinationals and final users were involved at different stages in the development process.\nAll the research activities presented in this work are responding to a new demand for AT devices by people with disabilities and try to give solutions to the new challenges on Assistive Technologies", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04162018-112020", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1533239608000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262007000, "depositedDate": 1532559600000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Designing Assistive Technology solutions for people with disabilities", "topics": ["ING-INF/01"], "types": [], "year": 2088, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/160011710", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04162018-112020/", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04162018-112020/", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04162018-112020/"], "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04162018-112020", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "60639650", "authors": ["Jimeno Revilla, Raquel"], "contributors": ["Fern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez, Purificaci\u00f3n (dir.)", "UAM.

It consist in the prediction of the secondary structure of the RNA given the primary structure (its sequence of bases). This has a great importance in biology since the RNA is the courier of the information linking the DNA with the the final biological element built. Moreover miRNA strings are gene expression regulators and there are many metabolic functions that could be fully understood.\nThe correct prediction of the RNA secondary structure would have many applications in many biologic fields, and in general would help to understand new roles of unknown string sequences or to create new ones from scratch with specific aims.\nThe secondary structure of a sequence of RNA is not easily predictable due to many factors.\nThe main problem to face up with is the dimension of the folding space: every sequence can fold and generate different structures depending on various conditions. This complexity leads to an NP-hard problem.\nIn order to tackle that, the problem has been identified and a Deep Learning approach has been used to search for solutions in different directions respect the classic methods. The model has been fed with only the sequences and no more information about thermodynamics or other constrains.\nThe dataset used is from RNA STRAND 2.0. Before the experiment a pre-processing step has been done on the input dataset in order to prepare the input data to be fed to the model as tensor with a one-hot encode of the sequences. Moreover a 5-fold cross-validation step has been added because of the limited dimension of the dataset.\nThe work exploits LSTM and Dense layers to build a model capable to predict with higher values of the metrics respect the classic methods. More experiments have been done implementing the Attention feature and the Encoder-Decoder engine with the Keras Functional API.\nIn the last part of the experiment the appropriate metrics are chosen and calculated.\nFinally the results are analyzed and discussed. The last chapter contains a comparison among the Deep Learning experiment and the classic approaches. In particular the resulting metrics of the DeepFold model are compared with these of mfold, ProbKnot, CONTRAfold and RNAfold. As evidenced in the results the model has a potential to improve the actual results. Specifically it improves the single base prediction, predicting if the base will pair or not. Instead the network is still at early stages in understanding the very core concepts of RNA sequences and folding. The hardest learning for the model is the rule that every base that pairs is part of a couple of bases paired together. This is a bottleneck in the analysis of the results because the predicted sequence cannot be analyzed properly in terms of base pairs. A post-processing must be applied eventually. This leads to a new proposal to analyze the results. The available known metrics are used with new modifications in the formulas for cases when the biological meaning is lost with the prediction.\nThe programming language in this project is python and the Keras library has been used with the Tensorflow back-end in order to build the model.

Chest HRCT volumes with interstitial lung disease (ILD) measured by UIP-net were compared with those calculated with CALIPER, a well-known texture analysis software for ILD. Furthermore, the relations between the fibrotic extent assessed by both methods and the pulmonary function tests (PFTs), i.e. the forced vital capacity (FVC), the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were evaluated.\nSixty patients with HRCT and PFTs were included in the study. HRCTs were first analysed using UIP-net and then with CALIPER in order to calculate the pulmonary volumes with ILD.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient between UIP-net and CALIPER measurements was assessed.\nSpearman\u2019s correlation analysis of the covariates was used to evaluate a correlation between volumes with ILD measured by both methods and the PFTs.\nAn excellent intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.973 between UIP-net and CALIPER was found, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.768 to 0.992.\nFurthermore, negative significant correlations were evidenced between volumes with ILD measured by CALIPER and FVC (Rho = -0.403; p value < 0.001), DLCO (Rho = -0.476; p value = 0.009), and FEV1 (Rho = -0.322; p value = 0.003).

So, it should mobilize the school to renew reading\r\nteaching and learning methods, especially literary reading, the most deficient skill. This\r\nneed is especially relevant in secondary education, as reading habits decrease as young\r\npeople age.\r\nIn our study, we tried to tackle the lack of reading habits in a 10th grade Portuguese\r\nLiterature class, incompatible with the requirements of the subject program, especially\r\nthe Individual Reading Project. For this purpose, an action-research project was applied,\r\naccording to the project methodology. Therefore, we structured the project in four phases,\r\naccording to Serrano (2008): diagnosis, planning, application/execution and evaluation.\r\nThe reading project we developed was designed according to principles inherent to the\r\nreading modalities usually referred to as reading workshops, reading clubs or circles,\r\nbook clubs, virtual reading clubs or reader communities. It was applied during one school\r\nyear - 2017/2018.\r\nFor data collection and processing, in each phase of the project, we used qualitative\r\nmethods (direct participant observation, through focused observation grids, and content\r\nanalysis of the students' portfolios, through a categorical analysis grid). However, we also\r\nobtained quantitative data (through checklists).\r\nBoth the expected results and the objectives were achieved, and the project revealed\r\ngreat potential for the promotion of reading at school, not only in Portuguese Literature,\r\nbut also in other areas, namely through other projects that were later conceived and/or\r\napplied in the library, coordinated by the author, also the librarian teacher, with the\r\nparticipation of students from the sample-group of this study and others", "identifiers": ["oai:repositorioaberto.uab.pt:10400.2/9858", null], "language": {"code": "pt", "id": 35, "name": "Portuguese"}, "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "1946", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Reposit\u00f3rio Aberto da Universidade Aberta", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1606143526000, "metadataUpdated": 1611605030000, "depositedDate": 1595332666000}, "subjects": ["masterThesis"], "title": "Promo\u00e7\u00e3o da leitura no ensino secund\u00e1rio: os projetos de leitura em literatura portuguesa", "topics": ["Bibliotecas escolares", "Ensino secund\u00e1rio", "Projetos de leitura", "Leitura liter\u00e1ria", "Literatura portuguesa", "Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o a\u00e7\u00e3o", "Literary reading", "Portuguese literature", "School library", "Secondary education", "Reading project", "Action-research", "Project methodology", "ODS::04:Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de Qualidade"], "types": [], "year": 2023, "fulltextUrls": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/344681381.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/344681381", "http://hdl.handle.net/10400.2/9858"], "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/344681381.pdf", "oai": "oai:repositorioaberto.uab.pt:10400.2/9858", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/344681381.pdf"}]
