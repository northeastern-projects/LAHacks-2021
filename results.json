Specifically, recent advances in 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) have explored the possibility of expanding the use of mmWave beyond device communications and simple range sensing to a full-fledged imaging under low visibility conditions (fog, smog, snow, etc.). This thesis explores the use of mmWave imaging for humans, which could be incorporated into autonomous driving technology for pedestrian imaging in low visibility conditions.\r\nUnfortunately, certain challenges have been identified in mmWave imaging for humans, including its low resolution, the presence of fake artifacts resulting from multipath reflections, and the vibration of the human body. This thesis presents a system that can enable high-resolution mmWave imaging for humans that tries to address the above challenges by leveraging recent advances in deep learning, known as generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this thesis, we propose a GAN architecture that is customized to mmWave imaging and build a system that can significantly enhance the quality of mmWave images for humans.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/103999", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089626000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512130000, "depositedDate": 1560488515000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "High-resolution millimeter-wave imaging for humans", "topics": ["Millimeter-Wave imaging", "FMCW radars", "GANs", "Neural Network"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/103999", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291793305", "authors": ["Tao, Cheng"], "contributors": ["Schwing, Alexander G."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "This research aims to solve the problem of predicting the long-term sequential movements of\r\nan object in an image given a force vector applied to the object.

Neuroscientists and sleep experts work every day to understand how and what makes sleep more effective in its physical and mental recovery action. Among the most adopted techniques, the standard for the measurement of vital parameters on sleeping subjects is certainly Polysomnography. It is a method that involves many sensors and a laboratory environment, factors that introduce inconveniences that could negatively influence the sleep of the individual himself.\nIn this thesis we will base the experimentation on signals obtained through Ballistocardiography, a portable and less intrusive technique that deduces the heartbeat and respiratory acts based on the accelerations of the body lying on the bed due to forces imparted by the heart to the mass of blood that is pumped to the peripheral body systems.\nIn order to solve the problem of the parametric complexity of explicit analytical models of sleep quality in terms of \"sleep architecture\", in this work we propose a Deep Learning architecture based on multiple levels of Stigmergic Perceptrons. This approach describes a soft classification technique on time series with respect to a collection of archetypes, each representing a different behavioral class.\nFinally, the Deep Learning architecture is integrated with recurrent Long Short-Term Memory networks, known in literature for the classification of time series, above all for their ability to solve the problem of long-term dependencies over time. This technology is appropriate in order to establish a classifier able to recognize the level of quality of sleep declared by the subjects of the measurements and confirmed by a result obtained through the application of quantitative heuristics.\nKeywords: Deep Learning, Sleep Quality, Ballistocardiography, Stigmergic Perceptron, LSTM network\n[Italian]\nSono molto noti gli effetti negativi dovuti ad un sonno non adeguato in esseri umani di qualiasi et\u00e0.

Si tratta di un metodo che prevede molti sensori e un ambiente di laboratorio, fattori che introducono scomodit\u00e0 che potrebbero influenzare negativamente il sonno dell'individuo stesso.\nIn questa tesi baseremo la sperimentazione su segnali ottenuti tramite Ballistocardiografia, una tecnica portabile e meno intrusiva che deduce il battito cardiaco e gli atti respiratori in base alle accelerazioni del corpo giacente sul letto dovute a forze impartite dal cuore alla massa di sangue che viene pompata ai sistemi periferici del corpo.\nAl fine di risolvere il problema della complessit\u00e0 parametrica dei modelli analitici espliciti della qualit\u00e0 del sonno in termini di \"architettura del sonno\", in questo lavoro si propone una architettura di Apprendimento Profondo basata su pi\u00f9 livelli di Percettroni Stigmergici. Questo approccio descrive una tecnica di classificazione soft su serie temporali rispetto ad una raccolta di archetipi, ciascuno rappresentante una differente classe comportamentale.\nIn fine, all'architettura di Apprendimento Profondo si integra l'uso di reti ricorrenti Long Short-Term Memory, note in letteratura per la classificazione di serie temporali soprattutto per la loro capacit\u00e0 di risolvere il problema delle dipendenze a lungo termine nel tempo.

In this respect, the need has emerged for the implementation of an Object Detection algorithm, also aimed to remove license plates, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN), and persons from images used for insurance purposes, by relying on the supervised learning of deep neural networks. The technological part was realized using the TensorFlow framework, which allowed to implement a customized RetinaNet model in line with the anonymization task requirements that were specifically sought by the project client. In addition, the work carried out during the project provided the basis for further context analysis. The object of this additional survey concerns the possible ways of leveraging the most recent artificial intelligence tools in insurance business processes, in order to support a digital transformation strategy focused on value deriving from meaningful interpretation and management of data. The results which were obtained from the literature review show how the implementation of machine learning-based and deep learning-based tools allow insurance companies to improve their data-driven processes, unlocking value from the analysis of both structured and unstructured data (e.g., images).

This model can be obtained by using image-based or image-free techniques. Image-based techniques rely on the segmentation of pre-operative scans. Segmentation is typically done manually, which is a time-consuming process that requires technical expertise. Image-free techniques were developed to avoid this preoperative step and rely on intraoperative surface scanning and bone morphing algorithms to create a patient-specific model during surgery. Recent advances in machine learning have aided the development of novel segmentation algorithms, which may eventually enable automation of the segmentation process in image-based techniques.\nIn this work, we assessed the accuracy of digital models of a cadaveric femur obtained using three different systems (manual segmentation, a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm and a commercial image-free surgical system), by comparing them to high resolution optical scans of the exposed femur, which is used here as the gold standard.\nOne cadaveric knee was used for this study. Ethical approval was obtained from the Imperial College Healthcare Tissue Bank (project R13066-3A) and the cadaveric knee was sourced from an approved supplier. The intact sample was scanned using a Siemens Spectra MRI system to obtain the images needed for the image-based procedures.\nManual segmentation of the femur bone and cartilage was performed in 3D-Slicer by thresholding, followed by manual adjustment. A 3D model of the segmented volume was then generated using the same software.\nThe automated segmentation was performed using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed by Kayalibay et al. The neural network was trained to classify voxels into five categories (femur bone, femur cartilage, tibia bone, tibia cartilage, other) using 70 MRI volumes of the knee, available from the SKI10 challenge. Training required approximately 41 hours on an NVIDIA Tesla K80 Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). After training, the same neural network was used to segment an MRI scan of the specimen. The label maps obtained from the network were then converted into a 3D model using Matlab R2018a.\nThe knee specimen was prepared for optical surface scanning by attaching it to a custom-made metal rig using bone cement and exposing the distal end of the femur by performing a vertical cut as in a Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).\nTo obtain a gold standard measurement, 12 high resolution scans of the visible part of the femur head were obtained from different positions and orientations, using a Polyga HDI C210 3D Scanner. The scans were then aligned and merged using the FlexScan3D software, available from the camera manufacturer.\nThe specimen was then digitised using a commercial image-free surgical system. To this end, a reference array was attached to the femur using bone pins and, after standard calibration, the visible part of the femur was digitised using the system\u2019s probe. After this, the system\u2019s log files were downloaded to a USB drive to access the computed surface model.\nThe 3D models obtained with the different modalities were imported into Matlab as point clouds and were registered to the gold standard using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method. To summarise the accuracy of each method, the root mean square error (RMSE) was computed for each modality.\nManual segmentation is confirmed here to be the most accurate method, but it requires expertise and time. Hence, in order to alleviate the task for clinicians, image-free systems have gained in popularity.\nOur results show that the accuracy of a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm is still worse than with other methods, but inching towards the ballpark figure for image-free systems, albeit with the need for preoperative imaging of the patient, which would add time and cost to a navigated procedure.\nThese results suggest that machine-learning methods could become a powerful alternative to currently available segmentation techniques. With the attention that these methods have been receiving in recent years, and the rapid development of hardware and software tools for deep learning, the quality and speed of execution of these methods will continue to improve in the coming years, with a consequent impact on their speed, robustness, and overall accuracy", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04082019-175452", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1558627342000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262039000, "depositedDate": 1558306800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "An assessment of automatic segmentation of the knee joint based on machine learning", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'INFORMAZIONE"], "types": [], "year": 2089, "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-04082019-175452", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "358980538", "authors": ["BORGIOLI, NICCOLO'"], "contributors": ["Lazzerini, Beatrice", "Pistolesi, Francesco"], "datePublished": "2090-06-22T00:00:00", "description": "In an increasingly globalized modern society, where the life expectancy is keeping improving, humanity have to face an increasing threat: viruses.

Wild animals live together their own viruses from thousands of years and with evolution have developed an appropriate immune system to face them. The climatic change and the destruction of natural habitats increases the contact between wildlife and humans. This way, the spillover probability increases, exposing humans to unknown viruses with potentially catastrophic outcomes.

The diagnostic power of an ECG is related to the ability to timely and accurately identify specific heartbeat alterations (arrhythmia). Several approaches to the automated analysis of ECG signals have been proposed so far, in the attempt to improve the quality of arrhythmia detection.\nThe ECG signal, like many other biological signals, is generally non-linear, non-stationary, dynamic and complex: this hampers the extraction of characteristics to be used for any algorithmic analysis, with a severe impact on the efficiency of the overall diagnostic procedure. Specifically, the complexity of the ECG signal is related to the high variability of wave-form morphologies both for the same patient and across different patients, plus problems in the placements of electrodes on the patient\u2019s body.\nThis work aims to increase the accuracy and speed of ECG diagnostic systems with respect to the real-time detection of arrhythmia events. A deep learning (DL) approach is proposed as a means to deal with the high variability in ECG signals. The implemented neural network has shown to be able to detect, starting from raw data, high-level ECG characteristics, with good generalization ability.\nThe work is developed according to an \"intra-patient\" paradigm: the network is trained not only using generic samples, but also exploiting patient-specific data. The network consists of three convolutional layers, which are in charge of extracting features out of morphological information in ECG signals; subsequently, by considering also temporal features, the previous information is fed to a multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) to finalize the classification job.\nThe performance evaluation of the developed classifier has been carried out taking into account different pre-processing strategies, best representation of morphological and temporal features, data augmentation techniques and fine-tuning strategies.\nThe results over a classical, standard benchmark database (MIT-BIH DB), show that the network performance is comparable (and in some cases superior) to what it has been obtained in other works with the same paradigm.\nIn accordance with the AAMI recommendations, the most challenging classes to identify are the Supraventricular Ectopic Beat (SVEB) and the Ventricular Ectopic Beat (VEB). For this reason, the performance on this class, based on Sensitivity (Sen) and Positive predicted value (Ppv), are representative of the effective robustness of the overall approach. The network reaches 60.21% and 79.85% for the SVEB class and 91.05% and 95.34% for the VEB class in terms of Sen and Ppv respectively.\nSuch results show the competitive performance of this work with respect to the state-of-the-art.\nFinally, it is important to underline that the shallow depth of the network, as well as the limited number of steps to get to the final classification of input data, make the proposed system particularly well suited for real-time analysis in embedded devices", "identifiers": ["oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-01282020-161049", null], "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "540", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Archive - Universit\u00e0 di Pisa", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1599221868000, "metadataUpdated": 1611262066000, "depositedDate": 1598310000000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Development of a deep learning system for patient-specific real-time arrhythmia detection: Addressing choice of features and data imbalance", "topics": ["INGEGNERIA DELL'INFORMAZIONE"], "types": [], "year": 2090, "oai": "oai:etd.adm.unipi.it:etd-01282020-161049", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "237083179", "authors": ["SEVERINI, SILVIA"], "contributors": ["Bacciu, Davide"], "datePublished": "2089-10-04T00:00:00", "description": "Nowadays, almost every aspect of life depends on reliable high-quality software so there is a high demand for software tools that could help this development process.

In this thesis, we investigate how Multi-task Deep Learning can tackle these issues in the software development domain applying it to tasks that involve the manipulation of English and four programming languages namely Python, SQL, C#, and Java. We adapt the Transformer model architecture, actual state-of-the-art for sequence-to-sequence manipulation problems, to seven supervised tasks and the self-supervised language model and we explore whether we get benefits on the training of single tasks compared to multiple tasks together. We show the performance of our models and we compare our results with state-of-the-art counterparts that solved the tasks with the same datasets. We conclude that, given enough computing resources, Multi-task Deep Learning with the Transformer architecture is a promising framework to deal with software development domain tasks.

Since probabilistic reasoning and inference is a foundational technology of statistical learning programs, adoption of probabilistic programming systems has been growing in the past few years. Pyro is a commonly used probabilistic programming system written in Python that is based on the PyTorch deep learning framework and has become very popular for machine learning applications. However, since Pyro uses a deep learning framework to sample from distributions, there is a need to evaluate the approximate nature of computations and the resilience of probabilistic programs. Additionally, there is also a significant need to systemically test probabilistic programs to identify major errors.\r\nIn this thesis, we systemically evaluate, test, and analyze Pyro probabilistic inference functions and programs. Since mutation testing is a well-established approach to test software against fault injections, we apply mutations to Pyro inference functions by using MutPy, a mutation testing tool for Python programs. Specifically, we use three popular inference programs as our testing suite and conduct mutation injection experiments on the Pyro inference library. Next, we analyze the data corruption and the amount of error introduced by mutations on inference programs. We provide a collective study of mutation tolerance of Pyro inference functions and programs where we also analyze mutation operators of MutPy and high-order mutations.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104038", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1561103076000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009268000, "depositedDate": 1560834131000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "A quantitative study of mutation and fault tolerance of pyro inference programs", "topics": ["Probabilistic Inference", "Mutation Testing", "Fault Tolerance"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104038", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "324164916", "authors": ["Sarkar, Ayush"], "contributors": ["Nahrstedt, Klara"], "description": "Smart contracts in blockchains can be executed for identifying and verifying images, text,\r\nsignatures, information within forms and legal documents, etc., by collusions over network,\r\nbenefitting various industry use cases.

This challenge demands a computationally efficient solution to enable machine learning or deep learning for the edge.\r\nTowards this goal, this research focused on developing a system to accelerate video inference by utilizing deep in memory architecture (DIMA) ICs designed and prototyped recently in our research group. The DIMA IC embeds mixed-signal compute blocks within SRAM memory array to accelerate machine learning models for image classification with 3.1x higher power efficiency and 2.1x lower inference latency. While DIMA IC achieved fast inference on single cropped images, its overall test setup was not optimized for video inference. To address this issue, we replaced the original MCU + PC in the previous setup with a Raspberry Pi and enabled it to directly process image information and control the chip. As a result, the system performance improved from more than 10 seconds per image to around 13 ms inference time. This also enabled us to complete the system with real camera input. With frames streaming into the Raspberry Pi, it will preprocess the image and regional proposal for the chip.

From a gestures' perspective, there are predefined human postures that must be performed in a precise manner. However, for several people, these postures are not correctly performed, due to being new to Salat or even having learned prayers in an incorrect manner. Furthermore, the time spent in each posture has to be balanced. To address these issues, we propose to develop an artificial intelligence assistive framework that guides worshippers to evaluate the correctness of the postures of their prayers. This paper represents the first step to achieve this objective and addresses the problem of the recognition of the basic gestures of Islamic prayer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The contribution of this paper lies in building a dataset for the basic Salat positions, and train a YOLOv3 neural network for the recognition of the gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that the mean average precision attains 85% for a training dataset of 764 images of the different postures.

Monitoring of animal life with image recognition in natural habitats is essential for animal health and production. Currently, Sheep Pain Facial Expression Scale (SPFES) has become the focus of monitoring sheep from facial expression. In contrast, pain level estimation from facial expression is an efficient and reliable mark of animal life. However, the manual assessment is lack of accuracy, time-consuming, and monotonous. Hence, the recent advancement of deep learning in computer vision helps to classify facial expression as fast and accurate. In this paper, we proposed a sheep face dataset and framework that uses transfer learning with fine-tuning for automating the classification of normal (no pain) and abnormal (pain) sheep face images. Current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) based architectures are used to train the sheep face dataset. The data augmentation, L2 regularization, and fine-tuning has been used to prepare the models. The experimental results related to the sheep facial expression dataset achieved 100% training, 99.69% validation, and 100% testing accuracy using the VGG16 model. While employing other pre-trained models, we gained 93.10% to 98.4% accuracy. Thus, it shows that our proposed model is optimal for high-precision classification of normal and abnormal sheep faces and can check on a comprehensive dataset.

Since probabilistic reasoning and inference is a foundational technology of statistical learning programs, adoption of probabilistic programming systems has been growing in the past few years. Pyro is a commonly used probabilistic programming system written in Python that is based on the PyTorch deep learning framework and has become very popular for machine learning applications. However, since Pyro uses a deep learning framework to sample from distributions, there is a need to evaluate the approximate nature of computations and the resilience of probabilistic programs. Additionally, there is also a significant need to systemically test probabilistic programs to identify major errors.\r\nIn this thesis, we systemically evaluate, test, and analyze Pyro probabilistic inference functions and programs. Since mutation testing is a well-established approach to test software against fault injections, we apply mutations to Pyro inference functions by using MutPy, a mutation testing tool for Python programs. Specifically, we use three popular inference programs as our testing suite and conduct mutation injection experiments on the Pyro inference library. Next, we analyze the data corruption and the amount of error introduced by mutations on inference programs. We provide a collective study of mutation tolerance of Pyro inference functions and programs where we also analyze mutation operators of MutPy and high-order mutations.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104038", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089627000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512130000, "depositedDate": 1560834131000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "A quantitative study of mutation and fault tolerance of pyro inference programs", "topics": ["Probabilistic Inference", "Mutation Testing", "Fault Tolerance"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104038", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158322032", "authors": ["Wang, Bangqi"], "contributors": ["Parameswaran, Aditya"], "description": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers and the second leading\r\ncause of death among American men.

While these techniques can achieve reasonable performance on servers or workstations equipped with multiple GPUs, they cannot be easily deployed on edge or IoT platforms. This challenge demands a computationally efficient solution to enable machine learning or deep learning for the edge.\r\nTowards this goal, this research focused on developing a system to accelerate video inference by utilizing deep in memory architecture (DIMA) ICs designed and prototyped recently in our research group. The DIMA IC embeds mixed-signal compute blocks within SRAM memory array to accelerate machine learning models for image classification with 3.1x higher power efficiency and 2.1x lower inference latency. While DIMA IC achieved fast inference on single cropped images, its overall test setup was not optimized for video inference. To address this issue, we replaced the original MCU + PC in the previous setup with a Raspberry Pi and enabled it to directly process image information and control the chip. As a result, the system performance improved from more than 10 seconds per image to around 13 ms inference time. This also enabled us to complete the system with real camera input. With frames streaming into the Raspberry Pi, it will preprocess the image and regional proposal for the chip. The chip will accelerate the image classification process and provide the system with real-time object recognition capability.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for general acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/103997", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1561103076000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009268000, "depositedDate": 1560488515000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "DIMA system for real-time object detention", "topics": ["Deep In-Memory Architecture", "Machine Learning System", "Hardware Acceleration", "Object Detection"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/103997", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158324759", "authors": ["Liu, Shuijing"], "contributors": ["Parameswaran, Aditya", "Peng, Jian"], "description": "Prostate cancer diagnosis by biopsy images of human tissue requires experienced trained pathologists and the cost is high.

It recognizes the sensitive relationship between knowing and emotions. The concept was devised by Robert Jerome Starratt in a dissertation entitled, The Individual and the Educated Imagination: An Essay in Curriculum Theory, which was accepted by the Graduate College of the University of Illinois in 1969. Building on the Starratt concepts which were geared for a secondary school curriculum, this study attempts to identify the factors influencing elementary school climates which promote the learning experiences described in the first sentence. Two elementary schools were studied which might be placed at opposite ends of a continuum ranging economically from poor to affluent. The study is concerned with multiple forces affecting the schools over the ten year period, from the filing of the Starratt dissertation to the completion of the present study. The study focused on such broad influences as declining enrollments, desegregation and political forces which are changing the course of education in the United States.The study advances the premise that curriculum theory and program changes are not likely to succeed unless the underlying forces affecting the educational climate are understood and controlled. The study also suggests that one of the best hopes for achieving the kinds of knowing interlaced with feeling is through improvements in the teacher education process. The value of university laboratory schools in this process is carefully explored. Finally, the delicate relationship between available resources, number of positions, change and the conservation of the school's heritage is a primary concern.

It recognizes the sensitive relationship between knowing and emotions. The concept was devised by Robert Jerome Starratt in a dissertation entitled, The Individual and the Educated Imagination: An Essay in Curriculum Theory, which was accepted by the Graduate College of the University of Illinois in 1969. Building on the Starratt concepts which were geared for a secondary school curriculum, this study attempts to identify the factors influencing elementary school climates which promote the learning experiences described in the first sentence. Two elementary schools were studied which might be placed at opposite ends of a continuum ranging economically from poor to affluent. The study is concerned with multiple forces affecting the schools over the ten year period, from the filing of the Starratt dissertation to the completion of the present study. The study focused on such broad influences as declining enrollments, desegregation and political forces which are changing the course of education in the United States.The study advances the premise that curriculum theory and program changes are not likely to succeed unless the underlying forces affecting the educational climate are understood and controlled. The study also suggests that one of the best hopes for achieving the kinds of knowing interlaced with feeling is through improvements in the teacher education process. The value of university laboratory schools in this process is carefully explored. Finally, the delicate relationship between available resources, number of positions, change and the conservation of the school's heritage is a primary concern.

There are several improvements to the design and implementation of this framework which this research work introduced: specifically speaking, long execution times of training and correspondence detection stages were reduced significantly by parallelizing these stages; new NN bootstrapping procedure enhanced the quality of NN training procedure; we introduced a new image preprocessing technique which improved the ratio of correct correspondence matches; we performed an in-depth comparative study of matching performances of ML-based interest point detector, SIFT and SURF algorithms which provided valuable points for understanding strengths and weaknesses of NN detector.

The methodology can find conceptual patterns in data as illustrated by three sample problems. In one problem, the method is used to rediscover categories of soybean disease when given a collection of 47 descriptions of diseased soybeans having one of four diseases. In a second problem, the method is used to find categories underlying a collection of blocks-world structures. In a third problem, categories of objects having a more complex structure are determined and contrasted with categories generated by people.The described method of conjunctive conceptual clustering forms clusters of objects (or situations) not on the basis of a numerical similarity measure but on the basis of the &quot;conceptual cohesiveness&quot; of one object to another. The conceptual cohesiveness between two objects depends on the descriptions of the two objects as well as the descriptions of other nearby objects in the given collection and concepts which are available to describe object groups or object configurations as a whole. From a collection of objects, some background domain knowledge, and a goal or purpose for clustering, conceptual clustering generates a hierarchical classification composed of clusters of objects and corresponding conjunctive-form cluster descriptions (concepts). Conceptual clustering is one paradigm of &quot;learning from observation&quot; in which no teacher guides the learning process.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/69539", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1432659637000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008958000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Conjunctive Conceptual Clustering: A Methodology and Experimentation (Learning)", "topics": ["Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/69539", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158304781", "authors": ["Li, Xiaoming"], "contributors": ["David Padua"], "description": "99 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2006.We follow a similar approach and use a classifier learning system to generate high performance libraries for matrix-matrix multiplication.

S."], "description": "This thesis describes an exploration of methods involved in learning flexible concepts that is an important and less explored area in machine learning. The two approaches described in this thesis are based on the idea of two-tiered (TT) concept representations. In the TT representation, the first tier, called the Base Concept Representation (BCR), contains an explicit description of core concept properties, and the second tier, called the Inferential Concept Interpretation (ICI), defines allowable modifications of the explicit meaning and its dependence on the context of discourse.The first approach generates a BCR of a concept by first creating a complete and consistent (CC) description from supplied training examples, and then optimizing the description according to a general description quality (GDQ) criterion. The CC description is obtained by applying the AQ inductive learning methodology. The optimization process is done by a double-level best-first search, using the SG-TRUNC description reduction process. The ICI consists of a user-specified procedure of flexible matching and a set of inference rules. This approach has been implemented in the POSEIDON learning system, and experimentally tested on two different real-world problems.In the second approach, a concept is presented as a set of extended complexes and a set of exemplars. Each extended complex is a generalized description and consists of a base complex (equivalent to a disjunct), a similarity measure, a threshold, and a set of weights. Accordingly, the task of learning a concept is to create a set of extended complexes and a set of exemplars. An extended complex is generated in two phases: base complex generation and extended complex optimization. When generating an extended complex, two evaluation functions, quality evaluation function and potential quality evaluation function are applied. This approach has been implemented in FCLS that is tested in various domains including artificial and real world domains.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19027", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384573000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008589000, "depositedDate": 1305500400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Learning flexible concepts from examples: Employing the ideas of two-tiered concept representation", "topics": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19027", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "17355589", "authors": ["Tursun, Umit Deniz"], "contributors": ["Nedich, Angelia", "Nedich, Angelia", "Beck, Carolyn L.", "Stipanovi\u0107, Du\u0161an M.", "Voulgaris, Petros G."], "description": "The first focus of this thesis is to solve a stochastic convex minimization problem over an arbitrary family of nonempty, closed and convex sets. The problem has random features. Gradient or subgradient of objective function carries stochastic errors. Number of constraint sets can be extensive or infinitely many. Constraint sets might not be known apriori yet revealed through random realizations or randomly chosen from a collection of constraint sets throughout the horizon as in online learning concept. \r\n\r\nThe traditional  projection algorithms for solving minimization problems require projecting over  complete collection of constraints at once or  over a subset of them based on a predefined selection rule. But in practical applications  either all of the constraints might not be known  apriori or even if they are known projecting on the intersection set might be computationally prohibitive. We propose a two step gradient/subgradient iterative\r\nmethod with random projections. As the first step, a  random gradient /subgradient projection is performed before observing the random constraint set realization. After taking random gradient /subgradient projection step we  reach an intermittent point, which we obtained without considering the feasibility violation.  Once the set realization is revealed or chosen within collection of constraint sets, the feasibility violation of  intermittent point is corrected.    We showed that projecting onto a random subcollection of them using our algorithm with diminishing stepsize is sufficient to  converge to the solution set almost surely.   Also the convergence of the algorithm for constant and  nondiminishing nonsummable stepsizes are proved  within an error bound. As the first set of experiments we tested the  performance of the  algorithm over a dynamic control system.  We study three versions of the problem with  correlated unknown-but-bounded additive noise, uncorrelated unknown-but-bounded additive noise and uncorrelated bounded output and peak input additive noise under fully known system description  cases. It is essentially a robust least squares estimation problem where we recover state parameters  from corrupted input and output data. We reformulated the linear least squares estimation problem  as a stochastic convex minimization problem and  then used  the  two step random projection algorithm to solve it. Although the problem has infinite number of constraints due to each realization of error term within bounded set, the algorithm goes through a finite subset of them and converges to the solution set.  We also prove the existence of solution and provide equivalent  minimization formulations or upper bound for these three types of  robust least squares problems.  We used standard subgradient algorithm  to gauge the performance of our method.  The implementation results are comparable to the ones found in literature. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur next focus is to solve a stochastic convex feasibility problem.  We explored  an algorithmic approach to solve both consistent and inconsistent convex feasibility problems for closed convex uncertain sets. We concentrated our  attention  on uncertain nature of sets and finding a feasible point using a random subcollection of them.  The  sets we consider might carry uncertainty due to inaccurate or imprecise  spatial, spectral,  stochastic information and confidence levels.    For this objective  we consider a stochastic optimization problem of minimizing an expected weighted  proximity function over a collection of closed, convex sets. We  show that the proposed algorithm converges to a point in the solution set when solution set  is nonempty. In case of inconsistent feasibility problem i.e. the intersection  of closed convex constraint  sets being empty the algorithm minimizes the proximity  function. The  projection onto a subcollection of sets approach  can  be viewed as somewhere between random implementation of alternating projection method and parallel projection method. But our method is not deterministic. It  uses random projections onto sets that carry additive bounded noise.   Each realization within the bounded disturbances has equal chance of occurence.\r\nThe conventional approach of set theoretic estimation problems provide solution that confirm with constraint sets known a priori or observed. But it fails to take into account that sets built on a priori or observed data  may carry disturbances or have erroneously predicted statistical information, which may  result in inconsistent sets.  The attributes of original signal such as amplitude bound, region of support, band-limitedness that are used to built sets in  estimation problems may not be accurate. Additionally  sets that are built using moments, spectral properties, distribution and bounds information  are based on predicted stochastic estimations. The overly conservative confidence bounds or statistical assumptions may cause inconsistencies.  Also noise pertubations in measurements or random variations in the impulse response of a system can cause inconsistencies. Our algorithm projects onto a subcollection of sets some of which carry a random realization of noise on it. The implementation results show that the  algorithm converges to the solution asymptotically even if the algorithm projects onto a random subcollection of sets at each iteration.\r\n\r\nAll in all this thesis work presents iterative methods to solve stochastic convex minimization problems and stochastic convex set intersection problems. The almost sure convergence of algorithms are proven. And the performance of them are shown on numerical experiments.U of I OnlyAuthor's request via GC", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/45381", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1382533428000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008787000, "depositedDate": 1382310000000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Random projection methods for stochastic convex minimization", "topics": ["stochastic convex minimization", "random projection", "stochastic convex feasibility problem"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/17355589.pdf", "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/45381", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/17355589.pdf"}, {"id": "158322008", "authors": ["Kumar, Maghav"], "contributors": ["Brunner, Robert"], "description": "Trees have been known as the most important nonlinear structures that arise in computer science.

This methodology functions as a model translator, changing the representation of analysis knowledge embedded in a unidirectional simulator, into a multidirectional model that supports design synthesis. This methodology requires addressing two issues.The first is the task of learning models from data in specified representations. This thesis describes an empirical learning algorithm called KEDS, the Knowledge-based Equation Discovery System. The user selects a restricted hypothesis space bias in the form of a class of parameterized (polynomial) model families, and KEDS learns accurate models that are restricted to those forms. In addition to being a model-driven empirical discovery system, KEDS is also a conceptual clustering system that partitions the problem domain based upon the relationships that it discovers among the problem variables. The use of the minimum description length (MDL) principle as a preference bias for KEDS provides a foundation for learning the &quot;best&quot; models (i.e., those that minimize predictive error on unseen data). KEDS has been applied to model three real-world domains: a diesel engine combustion chamber, a CMOS circuit for an operational amplifier, and a turning process on a lathe.The second issue is that of supporting early stage design. Current computer-aided methods for product and process design require the iterative use of computer-based analysis models in a generate-and-test fashion. While this process is essential to optimize performance during the final stages of design, it has a number of disadvantages during early design. By restricting the models families used by KEDS to forms that can provide synthesis support (hyperplanes), the user can learn a multidirectional model. The user can use this model to propagate constraints in the analysis as well as the synthesis direction. This avoids the time-consuming traditional procedure of iteratively using analysis models to support synthesis. Further this multidirectional model provides the user with great flexibility during early stage design, and the valuable ability to perform &quot;What-if?&quot; analysis. The inverse engineering methodology has been successfully applied to learn models to support early product design of combustion chambers for diesel engines, and to support process design for a turning machine.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72004", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089327000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511971000, "depositedDate": 1458175690000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Inverse Engineering: A Machine Learning Approach to Support Engineering Synthesis", "topics": ["Engineering, Electronics and Electrical", "Artificial Intelligence", "Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72004", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291773197", "authors": ["Agarwal, Shivani"], "contributors": ["Roth, Dan"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "106 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.Finally, we demonstrate a practical application of bipartite ranking to a problem in bioinformatics, namely the problem of identifying genes related to a given disease based on microarray data.

Expressing concepts by using only primitive (low-level) attributes is intricate because the contribution of each attribute to the definition is almost unnoticeable. This aggravates attribute interaction, a situation where an attribute's effect on classification depends on the value of other attributes. When attribute interaction is complex, involving many combinations of several attributes, current learners cannot handle it. Such complex interaction appears in real-world domains (e.g., protein folding). These domains are not random; they have structure although it may be concealed by the complexity of the interactions. Concepts in these domains often have embedded, implicit structure, which may be revealed through explicit relations. Because of the existence of structure, there is still hope for learning despite complex attribute interaction if appropriate techniques are devised. The design of these techniques, however, must be guided by a required functionality: finding interactions, more precisely, finding relations. In particular, this thesis focuses on interactions due to complex relations among primitive attributes. Then, concepts can be simple in terms of relations, but complex in terms of primitive attributes. Such focus is motivated by relations that appear in protein folding and other domains. To facilitate learning when relations create complex interactions, an approach based on the algebraic notions of relation and relational operators is proposed. The approach is implemented in MRP, a learning system that relies on multidimensional relational projection to find relations and hence, find interactions that can be captured as relations among attributes. Synthetic and real-world problems are used to empirically evaluate MRP with respect to five classical and advanced machine learning systems. MRP's distinctive behavior is analyzed in terms of concept characteristics (such as DNF size, entropy, variation, and Fourier spectrum), and related to the system's performance in real-world domains. Finally, a small family of simplified versions of MRP is evaluated empirically to analyze what components of MRP are responsible for its improved performance, and this analysis is used to focus the proposal for future research directions and system extensions.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/81874", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089407000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512006000, "depositedDate": 1458174400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Learning Despite Complex Attribute Interaction: An Approach Based on Relational Operators", "topics": ["Artificial Intelligence"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/81874", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291718713", "authors": ["Reddy, Sudhakar Y."], "contributors": ["Lu, Stephen C-Y"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "Though simulation models are extensively used for detailed design analysis, their potential benefits for supporting early-stage design have not yet been harvested. This thesis presents a new design methodology, called Hierarchical and Interactive Decision Refinement (HIDER), which enables detailed simulation models to be utilized for early-stage design of engineering systems. HIDER uses a machine-learning approach for forming fast empirical models at different levels of abstraction from the detailed simulation models. Models for different subsystems and from different perspectives are formed in a uniform representation and are used together in a single design environment to provide decision support for system design.HIDER uses an interactive refinement approach, based on explicit use of multiple competing objectives, to enable the designer to quickly and effectively explore the overall design space. Multiple objective optimization produces sets of Pareto-optimal designs, and the tradeoffs between the different design and performance attributes in these sets are used to interactively refine a large initial design space guided by domain-independent heuristics as well as domain-dependent knowledge.A prototype implementation of HIDER, which integrates the adaptive modeling and the interactive refinement approaches with an artificial intelligence based design environment, has been developed to demonstrate and evaluate the methodology. Results from the evaluation of HIDER for the parametric design of a diesel engine are presented. The thesis also demonstrates the methodology for the system-level design of a wheel loader simultaneously from competing perspectives, using detailed and disparate simulation models for cycle time and stability analyses.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/22936", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586088884000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511764000, "depositedDate": 1417453759000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Hierarchical and interactive parameter refinement for early-stage system design", "topics": ["Engineering, Mechanical", "Engineering, System Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/22936", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291796967", "authors": ["Liu, Siyu"], "contributors": ["Shanbhag, Naresh R."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "While machine learning delivers state-of-the-art accuracy on many AI tasks, its performance has been limited by the cost of high energy consumption for memory bit-cell-array (BCA) usage.

Due to its mixed-signal nature, DIMA is sensitive to transistor-level spatial process variation and data-dependent non-idealities, which circuit simulation tools fail to capture. In order to have an accurate simulation of DIMA, an emulator is developed based on a model which considers the discharge transistor current equation and normal distribution of spatial threshold voltage variation. The result of the emulator is compared with the measurement of a 65 nm CMOS prototype IC running support vector machine (SVM) on face detection dataset from The Center for Biological & Computational Learning (CBCL) at MIT and predicted the inference accuracy with an error range less than 2%.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104026", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089626000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512130000, "depositedDate": 1560574935000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "Pydima: Evaluation on machine learning algorithms on deep in-memory architecture (DIMA)", "topics": ["in-memory", "machine learning", "always-on inference", "mixed-signal", "process variations", "circuit simulation"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104026", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291717426", "authors": ["Kadie, Carl Myers"], "contributors": ["Wilkins, David C."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "The research presented here focuses on modeling machine-learning performance. The thesis introduces Seer, a system that generates empirical observations of classification-learning performance and then uses those observations to create statistical models. The models can be used to predict the number of training examples needed to achieve a desired level and the maximum accuracy possible given an unlimited number of training examples. Seer advances the state of the art with (1) models that embody the best constraints for classification learning and most useful parameters, (2) algorithms that efficiently find maximum-likelihood models, and (3) a demonstration on real-world data from three domains of a practicable application of such modeling.The first part of the thesis gives an overview of the requirements for a good maximum-likelihood model of classification-learning performance. Next, reasonable design choices for such models are explored. Selection among such models is a task of nonlinear programming, but by exploiting appropriate problem constraints, the task is reduced to a nonlinear regression task that can be solved with an efficient iterative algorithm. The latter part of the thesis describes almost 100 experiments in the domains of soybean disease, heart disease, and audiological problems. The tests show that Seer is excellent at characterizing learning-performance and that it seems to be as good as possible at predicting learning performance.

The operation of a self-driving vehicle is built upon the cooperation of a vision system, radars and Global Positioning System (GPS). The vision system, as the most complex and vulnerable phase in this whole system, involves convolutional neural networks (CNN) as well as real-time pattern recognition. Previous research has studied adversarial attacks on pre-defined CNN models with known evaluation functions, and applied this attack on stationary images or in a dynamic environment with a relatively slow movement. However, no research has clearly presented the outcomes after a self-driving vehicle sustains such an attack in a real-world scene.\r\nIn this thesis, we report the process of building the platform to support a black-box test on an open-sourced self-driving system, Openpilot, and carrying out the attack on its vision system in a simulated program, Stunt Rally. This racing game is open-sourced, allowing customizing vehicle specs and tracks, which ensures complete flexibility and fidelity in our experiment. In order to simulate the scenario for Openpilot as controlling a physical car on a straight road, we built a data-streaming module and a real-time signal processing module. We verified the feasibility to simulate Openpilot functioning on highways based on our platform and evaluated trigger conditions in which an adversarial attack can be effective.

It involves mixing known proteins with formulated chemical cocktails, and using those with crystal formations to visually inspect the internal structure. An issue crystallographers face with this technique is that most formulations fail, and the conditions for making formulations succeed are largely unknown. To account for this situation, crystallographers often perform massive trials in parallel, automatically mixing cocktails and photographing the resulting solutions. Most laboratories still identify crystals by manual inspection. To obtain a high-accuracy and automatic classification of crystalline images in protein crystallization trials, we propose a machine-learning based approach. This approach takes a large number of bag-of-words features, of multiple types. Our experiments were performed on a labelled data set provided by Genentech. We evaluated the efficacy of multiple feature designs and classification methods. Through our experimentation, we find that over-fitting is a constant and high-grade risk given this data set and our large feature dimensionality.

Part of this research was to segment cells with standard methods (thresholding, dilation/erosion, and watershed transform) and then train a neural network to segment unedited images. The purpose of this was to see if a neural net can indeed segment images and if so to what degree. If this is successful, the network will be able to detect cancer more accurately than current detection methods. We trained the network to segment cells with upwards of 1,000 images and made adjustments so it would be as close to the standard segmentation results as possible. CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells were used to collect data. These cells were selected because they have a fairly circular structure which makes it easier for the network to locate and segment each cell.\r\nThe other half of the research was using cell cluster tracking to determine if cell clusters influence each other. Does one cluster\u2019s growth rate affect the rates of other clusters in the surrounding area? If so, what is their sphere of influence? Using the images we segmented with standard methods, we analyzed the properties of the cells. Recording the parent of a given cell after separation proved to be a difficult challenge. Clusters of cells are hard to identify due to the varying mobility and growth rates of the cells. We recorded their mass, cluster location, lineage, and growth rates.\r\nIn short, the work yielded two separate results. Machine learning resulted in a neural network being able to predict CHO cells with a high degree of accuracy given a binary mask and a raw image.

NVM technologies are\r\nmore desirable than DRAM in the respect that they have higher memory density and lower idle power\r\nconsumption making them useful for storing a bulk of the memory for a program at any given time.\r\nHowever, the sole use of NVM technologies cannot meet the low latency expectation that we have for\r\nfast computations. For this reason, researchers explore hybrid memory system designs that combine\r\nDRAM and NVM technology to get the benefits from each side of the spectrum. The main topic of\r\nresearch in this field is the page placement policy that decides when to move memory from NVM to\r\nDRAM. The difficulty in deciding a policy is to come up with a model or strategy that can effectively\r\npredict the next memory access. Due to the nature of memory accesses, it is very difficult to come up\r\nwith a model that can accurately represent this. Recently, techniques in machine learning can estimate\r\nmodels over training datasets. Through the use of machine learning, it may be possible to accurately\r\nlearn the model through training over past memory traces. The nature of our research in this paper is to\r\ntest the practicality association rule learning algorithm for page prediction. The test setting for\r\nexperimentation was the page ranking program executed on a non-uniform memory access (NUMA)\r\nsystem.

The system produces rules that are simple, understandable, and have appropriately tuned diagnostic performance. Comparison with other machine learning programs shows that CRLS also requires less processing time. The explanation for these very favorable results is related to the appropriateness and strength of the two components of learning bias applied here: unateness and non-equivalence symmetry.

Given a set of training examples, the goal of the inductive system is to create a description capable of classifying the training examples, yet general enough to accurately predict the classification of unseen examples. Often the original attributes describing the instances are inadequate to capture important regularities in the concept. New descriptors, constructed through the application of operators to the original attributes, can provide the proper vocabulary to create concise concept representations at the right level of generalization to be highly predictive. Constructive induction is the process of generating and applying new descriptors during inductive learning.The large number of possible constructive operators and combinations of attributes defines an enormous search space for the inductive process. Knowledge about the concept or problem domain can be used to guide the construction of new descriptors. This thesis lays the foundation of opportunistic constructive induction in the context of decision-tree assembly, providing a framework for dynamically applying fragments of knowledge to produce potentially useful descriptors or hypotheses. A two-staged process of generating candidate descriptors (hypothesis generation) and focusing the induction on the most promising (hypothesis ordering) has been developed and partially implemented. This thesis concentrates on the development of a hypothesis ordering mechanism that incorporates the evaluation of multiple objectives to identify the most promising descriptors. Experiments in four test domains demonstrate the hypothesis ordering mechanism to be a robust, effective method of significantly reducing the potential computational burden created by prolific hypothesis generation. In addition, preliminary investigation of hypothesis generation indicates that small amounts of knowledge can provide substantial increases in the predictive accuracy of the induced decision-trees.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/20262", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384575000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008601000, "depositedDate": 1320278400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Opportunistic constructive induction: Using fragments of domain knowledge to guide construction", "topics": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/20262", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158306241", "authors": ["Kim, HyunJoo"], "contributors": ["Lucio Soibelman"], "description": "219 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2002.A KDD framework was developed to convert construction project data into knowledge.

In this methodological procedure, the complexity of the construction data was considered to optimize the opportunities to discover valuable knowledge. To test the feasibility of the proposed approach, the KDD process framework was validated and tested with a database, RMS (Resident Management System), provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

In this thesis, the validation was conducted by comparing the results from the KDD process with estimations from a publication reference (RSMeans 2001) and project-control software (Monte Carlo simulation) used frequently by construction experts in industry. The result of the validation showed that the developed KDD framework would provide the construction manager the ability to identify possible project problems, such as causes of delays in activity, and to predict duration for dealing with the delayed activity.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/83195", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1528754462000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009066000, "depositedDate": 1458086400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning in Construction Project Databases", "topics": ["Artificial Intelligence"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/83195", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "210999274", "authors": ["Liang, Yucheng"], "contributors": ["Liang, Zhi-Pei"], "description": "In magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging, water and lipid suppression are often employed in order to detect the weak spectrum signal from metabolites.

This methodology functions as a model translator, changing the representation of analysis knowledge embedded in a unidirectional simulator, into a multidirectional model that supports design synthesis. This methodology requires addressing two issues.The first is the task of learning models from data in specified representations. This thesis describes an empirical learning algorithm called KEDS, the Knowledge-based Equation Discovery System. The user selects a restricted hypothesis space bias in the form of a class of parameterized (polynomial) model families, and KEDS learns accurate models that are restricted to those forms. In addition to being a model-driven empirical discovery system, KEDS is also a conceptual clustering system that partitions the problem domain based upon the relationships that it discovers among the problem variables. The use of the minimum description length (MDL) principle as a preference bias for KEDS provides a foundation for learning the &quot;best&quot; models (i.e., those that minimize predictive error on unseen data). KEDS has been applied to model three real-world domains: a diesel engine combustion chamber, a CMOS circuit for an operational amplifier, and a turning process on a lathe.The second issue is that of supporting early stage design. Current computer-aided methods for product and process design require the iterative use of computer-based analysis models in a generate-and-test fashion. While this process is essential to optimize performance during the final stages of design, it has a number of disadvantages during early design. By restricting the models families used by KEDS to forms that can provide synthesis support (hyperplanes), the user can learn a multidirectional model. The user can use this model to propagate constraints in the analysis as well as the synthesis direction. This avoids the time-consuming traditional procedure of iteratively using analysis models to support synthesis. Further this multidirectional model provides the user with great flexibility during early stage design, and the valuable ability to perform &quot;What-if?&quot; analysis. The inverse engineering methodology has been successfully applied to learn models to support early product design of combustion chambers for diesel engines, and to support process design for a turning machine.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72004", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1432659687000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008978000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Inverse Engineering: A Machine Learning Approach to Support Engineering Synthesis", "topics": ["Engineering, Electronics and Electrical", "Artificial Intelligence", "Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72004", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158322033", "authors": ["Wang, Brian"], "contributors": ["Vaidya, Nitin H."], "description": "This research explores ways to effectively use distributed machine learning while preserving\r\nprivacy.

Devices of various scales,\r\ncomplexities, and functionalities are deployed for different tasks. However, there exist technical\r\ndifficulties in many circumstances where physical deployments are challenging or require\r\nverifications beforehand. For example, it would be hard for a group of high school students, who\r\nhave no prior knowledge of circuits, to physically implement even the simplest circuit design.\r\nDevices that would be massively deployed without human supervision, such as ocean quality\r\nsensors, will also require verification in a simulation. Professor Matthew has been conducting\r\nresearch on virtualizing IoT devices, where he aimed to provide a platform to construct virtual\r\ncircuits and deploy them in the virtual world. This platform allows users to monitor simulated inputs\r\nand outputs through virtual consoles and change parameters and components of the circuits in a\r\nvirtual setup. To drive the virtual world, there should be an engine that simulates different aspects\r\nof the real world, such as movement, weather, etc. Taking the example of monitoring animals,\r\nthere should be simulators that generate both the animals and environment. To simulate animals,\r\nseveral attempts were made to accurately model different animals like zebra and lions. We initially used\r\nan FSM-like model with fixed states to describe different actions and conditions of an animal,\r\nthen moved forward to a learning-based model using different machine learning techniques, like linear regressions and neural networks. With a learning-based, or black-box model, animals act\r\nwith more flexibility, instead of only allowing to be in the several fixed states. Circuit emulation is\r\nalso an important feature in the overall virtualization process. There were two steps to create a\r\nvirtual device. The first step involved physical testing and modeling of the devices, and the second\r\nstep involved mapping them into scripts that describe their behaviors. These two components are\r\nessential parts for the entire IoT virtualization project since they generate all the simulations in the\r\nvirtual world, and they will be actively updated as we introduce more features to the project.U of I OnlyUndergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/107775", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1599185963000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009301000, "depositedDate": 1594999306000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "IoT virtualization for animal simulations", "topics": ["Internet of Things", "IoT", "Virtual Reality"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/107775", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291749292", "authors": ["Zeng, David"], "contributors": ["Liang, Zhi-Pei"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "Background: We have been provided MRI data of 10 healthy patients and 10 patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Each of the patients has images in T1, T2, susceptibility-weighted, and diffusion kurtosis contrast schemes. With the opportunity this large dataset presents, our project is to develop a machine learning-based diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\r\nMethods: The first part of the project is to register the images. This is accomplished using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8). The second part is to segment the images. Segmentation is performed in two ways: SPM8 segments the image by tissue type and a ramp transform method segments the image by features. The third part is to develop a machine learning algorithm to diagnose Parkinson\u2019s disease. In this thesis, the first two parts are addressed.\r\nResults: The image registration in SPM8 for healthy brains passes visual inspection. For brains with Parkinson\u2019s disease, there are concerns about distortions in the diseased areas of brains. Segmentation is performed on registered images so artifacts in registration propagate to segmentation. Segmentation by SPM8 of healthy brains passes visual inspection and segmentation of diseased brains have effects resulting from registration. Results from segmentation by the ramp transform have raised several issues on the limitations of the method and further work is needed to adapt the method.\r\nConclusions: The registration and segmentation parts of the project have had successful results for images of healthy brains. There are reservations on the effectiveness of the image processing on brains with Parkinson\u2019s disease but it will require development of the machine learning algorithm to fully evaluate the effects of the image processing.U of I OnlyUndergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/55634", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089176000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511901000, "depositedDate": 1458178693000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "MRI Registration and Segmentation for Machine Learning Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease", "topics": ["image registration", "image segmentation", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "MRI"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/55634", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291773505", "authors": ["Bulitko, Vadim V."], "contributors": ["Wilkins, David C."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "331 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2000.This interdisciplinary research has made the following  five main contributions: (1) A Petri Nets based approach to decision-making scheduling through environment modeling is presented. Petri Nets formalism is known for its solid theoretical base, clear syntax and semantics, intuitive graphic representation, and native concurrency support. (2) The classical Petri Net model is extended in various ways to make it suitable for AI scheduling tasks. The main extensions concern explicit temporal reasoning, context, and operator support. The new formalism is hence called Time Interval Petri Nets (TIPNs). (3) TIPN properties and relation to other Al and Petri Nets formalisms are studied. We also present analysis methods facilitating verification and refinement of Petri Net models. (4) Two machine learning algorithms are developed to synthesize Petri Net models automatically or semi-automatically. One learning algorithm exploits the connection between Petri Nets and Horn clauses by using inductive logic programming methods (ILP) to learn Horn-clauses first and then convert them to TIPNs. The other algorithm employs a general-to-specific search in the space of Petri Net topologies starting with a given initial topology. (5) The framework is applied in the real-time decision-making domain of ship damage control for the tasks of automated problem-solving and intelligent tutoring (advising, critiquing, and scoring). In a large exercise involving approximately 500 simulated ship crisis scenarios, our decision-making expert system showed a 318% improvement over Navy officers by saving 89 more ships.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/81968", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089408000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512007000, "depositedDate": 1458174583000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Envisionment-Based Scheduling Using Time Interval Petri Networks: Representation, Inference, and Learning", "topics": ["Artificial Intelligence"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/81968", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291773267", "authors": ["Zimak, Dav Arthur"], "contributors": ["Roth, Dan"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "120 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2006.Third, we address an important algorithm in machine learning, the maximum margin classifier.

This thesis introduces three practical data mining problems---(1) classifying with large data sets, (2) classifying without negative data (i.e., single-class classification), and (3) discovering discriminant feature combinations---and presents solutions that are based on a principled methodology, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to produce higher quality results with less human intervention. We first address several challenges in adopting SVM technology to the practice of data mining: (1) scalability: SVMs are unscalable to data size while common data mining applications often involve millions or billions of data objects, (2) applicability: SVMs are limited to (semi-) supervised learning which is mostly applied to binary classification problems, and (3) interpretability: It is hard to interpret and extract knowledge from SVM models. We then propose three principled solutions, which address these challenges, for the problems of the large-scale classification, the single-class classification, and the discriminant feature combination discovery. The contributions of this thesis cover the applications of bioinformatics and text-and-Web mining as well as methodologies of data mining and machine learning.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/81644", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089406000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512005000, "depositedDate": 1458174100000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Data Mining via Support Vector Machines: Scalability, Applicability, and Interpretability", "topics": ["Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/81644", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "380787176", "authors": ["Ribeiro, H\u00e9lder Ricardo Freitas"], "contributors": ["Ribeiro, Ant\u00f3nio Fernando"], "description": "Disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de Mestrado Integrado em Engenharia Eletr\u00f3nica Industrial e ComputadoresA coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de rob\u00f4s aut\u00f3nomos e a sua coopera\u00e7\u00e3o em tempo real \u00e9 uma tarefa altamente complexa e dif\u00edcil de alcan\u00e7ar, por esse motivo existem em todo o mundo competi\u00e7\u00f5es que visam o estudo deste problema.\r\nMINHO TEAM \u00e9 a equipa de futebol rob\u00f3tico da Universidade do Minho, que participa na liga de futebol rob\u00f3tico m\u00e9dio do RoboCup.

Current learning systems have significant limitations like brittleness, i.e. the deterioration of performance on a different domain or problem and lack of power required for handling real-world learning problems. The goal of my research was to develop an approach in which many of these limitations are overcome in a unified, coherent and general frame-work. This learning approach is based on techniques of reasoning, such as the discovery of the underlying principle and the recognition of the deeper basis of similarity which emulate human learning. In this thesis, the limitations of current systems are discussed, along with the arguments for using a different approach to learning. This thesis then presents a Reasoning-based Approach to machine learning the author developed, along with the details of a computer implementation. It also illustrates the approach on some learning problems not directly solvable by previous approaches.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19623", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384574000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008596000, "depositedDate": 1316041200000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "A probabilistic reasoning-based approach to machine learning", "topics": ["Information Science", "Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19623", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158304753", "authors": ["Sun, Qiang"], "contributors": ["Gerald DeJong"], "description": "135 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.We also present the comparison of the three proposed approaches, discuss about the related work, and point out some future work.

LCSs combine the strength of reinforcement learning with the generalization capabilities of genetic algorithms promising a flexible, online generalizing, solely reinforcement dependent learning system. However, despite several initial successful applications of LCSs and their interesting relations with animal learning and cognition, understanding of the systems remained somewhat obscured. Questions concerning learning complexity or convergence remained unanswered. Performance in different problem types, problem structures, concept spaces, and hypothesis spaces stayed nearly unpredictable. This thesis has the following three major objectives: (1) to establish a facetwise theory approach for LCSs that promotes system analysis, understanding, and design; (2) to analyze, evaluate, and enhance the XCS classifier system (Wilson, 1995) by the means of the facetwise approach establishing a fundamental XCS learning theory; (3) to identify both the major advantages of an LCS-based learning approach as well as the most promising potential application areas. Achieving these three objectives leads to a rigorous understanding of LCS functioning that enables the successful application of LCSs to diverse problem types and problem domains. The quantitative analysis of XCS shows that the interactive, evolutionary-based online learning mechanism works machine learning competitively yielding a low-order polynomial learning complexity. Moreover, the facetwise analysis approach facilitates the successful design of more advanced LCSs including Holland's originally envisioned cognitive systems.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/81646", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1528754434000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009053000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Rule -Based Evolutionary Online Learning Systems: Learning Bounds, Classification, and Prediction", "topics": ["Computer Science"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/81646", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "210999284", "authors": ["Tekgul, Hakan"], "contributors": ["Misailovic, Sasa"], "description": "Probabilistic programming allows users to model complex probability distributions and perform inference on such models. Since probabilistic reasoning and inference is a foundational technology of statistical learning programs, adoption of probabilistic programming systems has been growing in the past few years. Pyro is a commonly used probabilistic programming system written in Python that is based on the PyTorch deep learning framework and has become very popular for machine learning applications. However, since Pyro uses a deep learning framework to sample from distributions, there is a need to evaluate the approximate nature of computations and the resilience of probabilistic programs. Additionally, there is also a significant need to systemically test probabilistic programs to identify major errors.\r\nIn this thesis, we systemically evaluate, test, and analyze Pyro probabilistic inference functions and programs. Since mutation testing is a well-established approach to test software against fault injections, we apply mutations to Pyro inference functions by using MutPy, a mutation testing tool for Python programs. Specifically, we use three popular inference programs as our testing suite and conduct mutation injection experiments on the Pyro inference library. Next, we analyze the data corruption and the amount of error introduced by mutations on inference programs. We provide a collective study of mutation tolerance of Pyro inference functions and programs where we also analyze mutation operators of MutPy and high-order mutations.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104038", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1561103076000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009268000, "depositedDate": 1560834131000}, "subjects": ["text", "other"], "title": "A quantitative study of mutation and fault tolerance of pyro inference programs", "topics": ["Probabilistic Inference", "Mutation Testing", "Fault Tolerance"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/104038", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "190330247", "authors": ["Goldstein, Stephanie Paige"], "contributors": ["Forman, Evan M."], "description": "Failures to adhere to dietary recommendations in a weight loss program have been attributed to the notion that short-term violations of behavioral \u201crules\u201d (e.g., dietary lapses) can often precipitate a return to prior behavior patterns. Existing studies suggest that lapses are caused by a select group of internal and external cues, indicating that they may be predictable. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) can utilize mathematical models to learn the way in which triggers predict lapse behavior, and then communicate this knowledge to the individual in the form of momentary alerts to risk. The primary aim of the current study was to develop an initial machine learning model (accuracy > 70%, sensitivity > 70%, and specificity > 50%) capable of predicting lapse behavior in a sample of overweight and obese participants following a standardized weight control diet. Users (n = 12, MBMI = 33.6) were prompted to report on lapses and relevant triggers six quasi-random times per day via personal smartphone for six weeks. Participants reported an average of 3.47 lapses per week (SD = 2.41) and completed an average of 94.64% of prompts. This data was used to build a classification model (using C4.5 WEKA decision trees) to predict dietary lapses. The final model accuracy (.72) met our standards for success while maintaining good sensitivity (.70) and specificity (.72). Significance testing revealed this model predicted lapses better than random chance (p < .01). Further analyses related to data collection procedures, variable selection, and individual-level models are presented below. Results from this project indicate that machine learning holds promise for the real-time prediction of dietary lapse, and the algorithm from this project will be utilized in a JITAI application framework to predict and prevent lapses.M.S., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6683", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1554028613000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343044000, "depositedDate": 1551352849000}, "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "title": "A Preliminary Investigation of a Personalized Risk Alert System for Weight Control Lapses", "topics": ["Psychology", "Reducing diets", "Psychology", "Weight Loss"], "types": [], "year": 201603, "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6683", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "144500806", "authors": ["\u6734\u6d69\u73cd"], "contributors": [], "description": "Generally, Internet users have exploited search engines to find the information that they need. Such search engines require fast processing and particularly morphological analysis in Korean. The notorious problem in Korean morphological analysis is over-generation, which is caused by the lack of morphotactics. This paper describes the eojeol classification in order to lighten the burden of the over-generation. In other word, we want to reduce the search space for morphological analysis using eojeol categories. In this paper, we propose a method for eojeol classification using an instance-based learning technique.\n\n\nTo evaluate our proposed system, we use two test corpora (KAIST and ETRI) that are part-of-speech tagged in Korean. In addition, we use the cross validation method for training and evaluation since the test corpora are not enough. The average accuracies of the test corpora are 97% and 96.6% under 22 features, respectively, but the average accuracy is reduced into 95.5% even though the two corpora are combined. We believe that the tragedy results from the inconsistent tagging method in spite of the larger amount of training data. To select optimal features for our system, we employ backward sequential selection. As a result, we choose 16 features as the optimal features and the performance of our system is improved by about 0.2%. Furthermore the reduction rate is 35% on average when our system is applied to Korean morphological analysis.\ubaa9\ucc28\n\n\n1\uc81c\uc7a5 \uc11c\ub860 = 1\n\n\n2\uc81c\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828 \uc5f0\uad6c = 3\n\n\n 2.1 \ubd84\ub958 = 3\n\n\n 2.2 \uc0ac\ub840\uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 = 3\n\n\n 2.3 \uacb0\uc815\ud2b8\ub9ac = 5\n\n\n 2.4 \ubcc0\ud615\uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 = 6\n\n\n3\uc81c\uc7a5 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc5b4\uc808\ubc94\uc8fc = 8\n\n\n 3.1 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc5b4\uc808 = 8\n\n\n 3.2 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc5b4\uc808\ubc94\uc8fc = 9\n\n\n  3.2.1 \uccb4\uc5b8\uc808 = 10\n\n\n  3.2.2 \uc6a9\uc5b8\uc808 = 11\n\n\n  3.2.3 \uc218\uc2dd\uc5b8\uc808 = 12\n\n\n  3.2.4 \uac10\ud0c4\uc0ac = 12\n\n\n  3.2.5 \uae30\ud638 = 13\n\n\n4\uc81c\uc7a5 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc5b4\uc808 \ubd84\ub958 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c = 14\n\n\n 4.1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\uc131 = 14\n\n\n 4.2 \ud559\uc2b5\ub2e8\uacc4 = 15\n\n\n  4.2.1 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\uae30 = 16\n\n\n  4.2.2 \uc5b4\uc808\ubc94\uc8fc \ubd80\ucc29\uae30 = 18\n\n\n  4.2.3 \uc790\uc9c8 \ucd94\ucd9c\uae30 = 19\n\n\n  4.2.4 \uc0ac\ub840\uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 = 22\n\n\n 4.3 \uc2e4\ud589\ub2e8\uacc4 = 24\n\n\n  4.3.1 \uc790\uc9c8 \ucd94\ucd9c\uae30 \ubc0f \uc5b4\uc808 \ubd84\ub958\uae30 = 25\n\n\n  4.3.2 \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac\uae30 = 25\n\n\n5\uc81c\uc7a5 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 = 27\n\n\n 5.1 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub9d0\ubb49\uce58 = 27\n\n\n 5.2 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95 = 27\n\n\n 5.3 \uc5b4\uc808 \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5 = 28\n\n\n 5.4 \uc790\uc9c8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 = 29\n\n\n 5.5 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5 = 31\n\n\n 5.6 \uc624\ub958 \ubd84\uc11d = 32\n\n\n 5.7 \ud615\ud0dc\uc18c \ubd84\uc11d \ucd95\uc18c\uc728 = 34\n\n\n6\uc81c\uc7a5 \uacb0\uacfc \ubc0f \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ubc29\ud5a5 = 36\n\n\n\ucc38\uace0 \ubb38\ud5cc = 3", "identifiers": ["oai:repository.kmou.ac.kr:2014.oak/9270", null], "language": {"code": "ko", "id": 24, "name": "Korean"}, "publisher": "\u97d3\u570b\u6d77\u6d0b\u5927\u5b78\u6821", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2639", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50(KMOU)", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1514973775000, "metadataUpdated": 1609858365000, "depositedDate": 1487721600000}, "subjects": ["Thesis"], "title": "Korean Eojeol Classification Using Instance-based Learning", "topics": [], "types": [], "year": 56797, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/144500806.pdf", "oai": "oai:repository.kmou.ac.kr:2014.oak/9270", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/144500806.pdf"}]}, {"status": "OK", "totalHits": 2102320, "data": [{"id": "29170811", "authors": ["Gorske, Stanley Francis"], "contributors": [], "description": "91 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1978.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/68600", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1432659616000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008951000, "depositedDate": 1458086400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Studies of the Biology, Taxonomy, and Herbicidal Effects on Portulaca Oleracea L", "topics": ["Biology, Plant Physiology"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/68600", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "29174578", "authors": ["Spring, Bryan Quilty"], "contributors": ["Clegg, Robert M."], "description": "232 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.The dissertation is concerned with biophysical applications of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and development and application of fluorescence lifetime-resolved imaging microscopy (FLIM).

Several separate research topics are presented, including: investigation of the structural properties of a metal-DNA complex (M-DNA); development and characterization of a genetically encoded biosensor for monitoring intracellular redox potentials; image analysis for FLIM; and, a microfluidic mixing device for accessing microsecond reaction kinetics.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72398", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1432659696000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008981000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Development &Amp; Application of Fluorescence Spectroscopy &Amp; Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging to Biology &Amp; Medicine", "topics": ["Biophysics, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72398", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "29174519", "authors": ["Siuti, Nertila"], "contributors": ["Kelleher, Neil L."], "description": "132 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.Interest in chromatin biology has increased dramatically in the past decade due to discoveries of its involvement in important cellular activities including epigenetics, development, gene activity, etc. Changes in chromatin at the molecular level have also been linked to human disease such as cancer and are highly important in determining cell fate. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, are one of the mechanisms by which histones (the protein component of chromatin) signal changes in very dynamic nuclear networks. Here new types of mass spectrometry (MS) are used to decipher histone PTMs as they occur in combination, to generate a global view of all the modification networks throughout the genome, an initial step towards understanding the role they play human cells.Developments in technology have revolutionized our view of how post-translational switches can effect protein function and mass spectrometry has certainly helped propel the chromatin field in new directions. Unlike other MS based techniques, top down mass spectrometry, preserves all modified histone forms given that the sample in analyzed at the intact protein level. This methodology also allows for characterization of highly similar protein variants which are members of the same family. Protein forms expressed by human cells (H2B) and different rat tissues (H2A and H2B) were determined by top down MS. Using electron capture dissociation (ECD) for MS/MS of H2B isoforms, direct evidence for the expression of eight unmodified H2B forms and monoacetylated H2B.A was obtained from asynchronous HeLa cells. Surprisingly, the expression profile of H2B forms did not change in HeLa cells arrested in mitosis by colchicine or during mid-S, mid-G2, G2/M, and mid-G1 phases of the cell cycle. H2A and H2B variants did not show expression dynamics in different subsections of rat brain or different rat tissues.We have also developed a top down-like approach (middle down) which analyzes large peptides to characterize PTM profiles on histone H3. Interestingly, we were able to conclude that methylation and acetylation levels on histone H3 are highly effected by perturbations of DNA methylation. In the past years we have expanded the applications of top down and middle down MS to other chromatin-associated proteins like HMGA1. In this study we were able to link PTM dynamics (phosphorylation of Ser 43) on HMGA1a to DNA repair and the early events in apoptosis.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72339", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1432659695000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008980000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "From Technology to Chromatin Biology: Contemporary Mass Spectrometry of Histones and Chromatin Associated Proteins", "topics": ["Chemistry, Biochemistry"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72339", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158305436", "authors": ["Chang, Youngjung"], "contributors": ["Sahinidis, Nikolaos V."], "description": "150 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2006.Identification of transcription factor binding motif and sites is a crucial effort to elucidate gene regulatory networks and its combinatorial problem is   NP -hard.

I first summarize a conceptual framework for the study of social behavior inspired by the field of evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\"); I suggest complex social behavior evolves via co-option of mechanisms underlying basic forms of solitary behavior, such as feeding and reproduction. Next, I describe research with honey bees (Apis mellifera) to determine whether division of labor between workers is related to individual nutritional status. I found that bees performing foraging behavior have half the abdominal lipid stores of hive-workers. Then, I demonstrated experimental lipid depletion causes early onset of foraging, suggesting that a change in nutritional status can have a causal influence on behavior. Additionally, my results show that social interactions between workers are necessary for bees to attain high lipid stores as found in hive-workers, but that social interactions and nutrition act independently to influence foraging ontogeny. Because a nutritionally-depleted foraging force characterizes many social insect species, I investigated whether the nutritional mechanism and other molecular pathways influencing division of labor are conserved in an insect with independently evolved sociality, the paper wasp Polistes metricus. I also found low abdominal lipid in P. metricus foragers. I then developed an EST project of sequences representing approximately 5000 P. metricus genes. I examined the expression of a set of 32 P. metricus orthologs to genes known from previous studies to be associated with foraging behavior in worker honey bees. I found that expression of this set of genes differed significantly between P. metricus females in distinct behavioral castes. Expression patterns of individual wasps were predictive of behavioral state with a high (up to 80%) rate of success. In addition, I found 34% of genes to be associated with differences in wasp foraging state. In summary, I have demonstrated shared patterns of physiological and molecular regulation of social organization in two species with widely different forms of sociality. These results suggest several shared mechanisms underlying multiple origins of sociality and hint at the existence of a shared genetic \"toolkit\" for the evolution of social organization.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/85368", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1528754480000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009085000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Comparative Physiological and Genomic Analyses of Division of Labor in Honey Bees and Paper Wasps", "topics": ["Biology, Neuroscience"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/85368", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "4832014", "authors": ["Elliott, Timothy Scott"], "contributors": ["Visek, Willard J."], "description": "Dietary fat has been shown to exacerbate important chronic diseases including, heart disease, obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and cancer. This thesis described studies carried out to further our understanding of genes whose expression is altered by the level of dietary fat. The experimental approach was designed to obtain basic information in virgin female mice whose responses to dietary fat were not confounded by the production of a mammary tumor virus, hormonal events of pregnancy or the use of a chemical carcinogen. I have used molecular biology techniques to identify genes regulated by different levels of dietary fat. cDNA libraries were constructed from mammary tissue of virgin female Balb/c mice (7wks) fed a fat free diet for one week and then switched to either a 3 or 20% corn oil (co) diet for 2 wks. Subtractive hybridization of the lowfat cDNA library revealed genes expressed preferentially by mice fed the 3% co diet. These clones are designated lowfat mammary 1 and 2 (LFM-1, LFM-2). The diet regulated LFM-1 is a homolog to an UV-inducible gene. Since DNA repair enzymes are also induced by UV-irradiation, the identification of this single gene suggests that genes involved in DNA repair also may be regulated by dietary fat. Regulation of DNA repair genes by different levels of dietary fat may provide the first experimental link between the high fat diet and promotion of specific diseases.The second diet-specific cDNA, LFM-2, had homology to stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) which is the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids from acetyl-CoA in animal tissues. The regulation of SCD by dietary fat is not well understood at this time. The physiological importance of SCD is probably related to the production of oleic acid which is the major fatty acid constituent in mouse depot fat. In conclusion, the data presented in this thesis showed that different levels of dietary fat as 3 and 20% corn oil, can modulate the expression of specific genes. The identification of diet regulated genes will be useful in gaining understanding of the influence of macronutrients on tissue physiology and development.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23591", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384580000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008624000, "depositedDate": 1305241200000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Molecular analyses of differences in gene expression due to changes in the level of dietary fat", "topics": ["Biology, Molecular", "Health Sciences, Nutrition"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23591", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158309489", "authors": ["Tooker, John Frazier"], "contributors": ["Hanks, Lawrence M."], "description": "138 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2003.Tallgrass prairies used to dominate the midwestern United States, but have been reduced to <0.01% of their original pre-settlement area. The plant communities of this ecosystem are relatively well known and appreciated, but little is known of the biology of most insects that are endemic to prairie ecosystems of North America, with the exception of large and conspicuous species. In particular, species that are sequestered within plant tissues are commonly overlooked. With my research, I characterized the community of insect species that inhabit flowering stems of Silphium laciniatum L. and  S. terebinthinaceum Jacquin. I used stable isotope analysis to clarify the trophic position of several of the key members of the community, determining that the only beetle in the system is a facultative predator. Prairies are commonly managed using prescribed burns and endophytic insects seem quite vulnerable to burning because they occupy the herb or \"fuel\" layer of prairies, so I evaluated the impact of fire this insect community. I found fires decimate populations of these insects, but they recover quickly after the burn. I also studied host plant recognition by males and females of the gall wasp Antistrophus rufus Gillette whose larvae fed in  S. laciniatum and S. terebinthinaceum. I used olfactometry bioassays in the field and lab and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the chemical cues they use to identify their natal host plant species. I used allozymes to determine that sub-populations of A. rufus are specialized and reproductively isolated on their host plant species and then described the Antistrophus rufus species complex, providing descriptions and morphological diagnoses for A. rufus, and new species A. meganae Tooker and Hanks, and A. jeanae  Tooker and Hanks, which are associated with S. terebinthinaceum  and S. perfoliatum L., respectively. Lastly, I evaluated the impact of gall wasps and parasitoids on the reproductive output of their host plants, determining that parasitoids can mediate the impact of gall wasps and providing new evidence from a co-evolved, native system that parasitoids can influence plant fitness, perhaps selecting for plant characters that encourage natural enemy attack.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/86444", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1528754488000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009094000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Multitrophic Interactions in a Prairie Insect Community: Ecology, Behavior, and Conservation", "topics": ["Biology, Ecology"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/86444", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158309528", "authors": ["McClellan, Karen Rebecca"], "contributors": ["Novak, Robert J."], "description": "136 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2000.Culex pipiens was the only species collected from the Champaign-Urbana, overwintering site.

Furthermore, results suggested that temperature affected both follicle state and the quantity and quality of depot fats in overwintering females. The general trend in mean primary follicle lengths of females collected from the site was an increase in size from November to March. However, significant decreases in follicle length from January to February were noted for females collected from the coldest area of the site, corresponding to significant temperature decreases in this area during that time. Culex pipiens collected from October to January had very similar mean total fat values with only the value for March significantly less than values of females collected during previous months. Total fat values for mosquitoes collected from the warmest and coldest sections during January, February, and March were not significantly different. However, the results showed that females from the coldest area of the site lost their initial fat reserves at a slower rate than those collected from the warmest area. Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) showed the primary fatty acid in these females was the monounsaturate palmitoleic acid. Mosquitoes collected from the coldest section of the site in January had a greater mean percentage of palmitoleic acid than those collected from the warmest area. This suggested that, while females from the different sections had similar mean amounts of fat during this month, the qualities of their fat reserves were different.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/86483", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1528754488000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009094000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Overwintering Biology of Culex Pipiens Linnaeus (Culicidae) in East-Central Illinois", "topics": ["Biology, Entomology"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/86483", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "210999261", "authors": ["Hasan, Aamir"], "contributors": ["Vasudevan, Shobha"], "description": "Community Detection in heterogeneous graphs has important applications\r\nin various  fields such as sociology, biology and computer science.

Canopy architecture and biomass allocation change as plants mature, and can affect light interception and carbon budgets. Thus plant growth forms are expected to affect the light requirements of plants, and are therefore expected to influence demographic patterns.Measurements of plant architecture, biomass allocation, and light interception were taken from plant in the field, and photosynthesis was measured on plants in the growing house. Plant growth and demography studies were based on three years of data from natural populations.Compared to Scheelea, Socratea has less leaf overlap, leaves more horizontally displayed, lower biomass allocation to leaves, higher leaf turnover, lower photosynthetic rates, and lower ability to acclimate photosynthetically to higher light conditions. Socratea's efficient display of shade-adapted leaves allows it to reach maturity under relatively closed canopy or in small gaps. Socratea grows vertically even as a seedling, and can attain high density in the old forest on BCI. Scheelea tolerates understory conditions as a seedling, but as leaf overlap and proportion of non-photosynthetic biomass increase, it reaches a stage at which a large gap in the canopy is required for further growth. Scheelea persists in the understory as suppressed individuals, and partly due to the large gap requirement, the adults are widely scattered in the old forest.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/71283", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1432659672000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008973000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Plant Architecture, Photosynthetic Responses, and Population Biology in the Palms Socratea Durissima and Scheelea Zonensis on Barro Colorado Island, Panama (Physiological, Tropical)", "topics": ["Biology, Ecology"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/71283", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158310674", "authors": ["Cheng, Georgina"], "contributors": ["Lois L.

Candida albicans is the etiological agent in over 80% of vaginal candidiasis cases. Attributes of both C. albicans and the host contribute to development of vaginal candidiasis. The studies presented in this dissertation used two different experimental approaches to assess the effect of the host vaginal environment on the cellular and molecular biology of C. albicans. The first approach evaluated the expression of the eight agglutinin-like sequence (ALS) genes in clinical vaginal specimens and in models of vaginal candidiasis, including a murine model and an in vitro tissue model. The ALS genes encode large cell-surface glycoproteins that are candidates for aiding C. albicans colonization of the vaginal epithelium and/or for promoting development of vaginal disease. Vaginal-specific patterns of ALS gene expression were detected using reverse transcription-PCR and suggested that ALS gene expression is specific to the host site where  C. albicans cells are located. The second experimental approach was prompted by reports in the scientific literature that suggested a positive association between elevated estrogen concentration and the incidence of vaginal candidiasis. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of estrogen on the growth characteristics and transcriptional profile of C. albicans  cultured in defined media. Addition of estrogen to C. albicans  cells resulted in increased germ tube formation and length in an estrogen-, dose- and strain-dependent manner, but did not have a significant effect on culture biomass. Genes that were differentially expressed in the presence of estrogen were defined by microarray analysis and included  CDR1 and CDR2. Analysis of estrogen-exposed strain DSY654, that lacks CDR1 and CDR2 coding sequences, showed a significantly decreased number of germ tube-forming cells in the presence of estrogen. PDR16 was the most highly up-regulated gene in strain DSY654 under the growth conditions assayed. The cell biology and gene expression data led to a model to explain how components of the phospholipid and sterol metabolic pathways may interact to affect C. albicans germ tube formation and length. Collectively these two different experimental approaches produced new insight into the interaction between C. albicans  and the vaginal environment.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community

Linn"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "The goal of my graduate work has been to try to understand or explain some of\r\nthe reported magnetic field effects in biology (see Chapter 1 for examples) using the\r\nradical pair mechanism, a quantum mechanical mechanism known for over 20 years\r\nthat lets the yields of certain radical pair reactions depend on the applied magnetic\r\nfield [1, 2, 3]. This goal seems reasonable considering the known roles of many biological\r\nfree radicals in cancer, disease, aging, development, and cellular signaling,\r\nthe constant reminders in the media to take anti-oxidant vitamins to protect against\r\ndangerous free radicals, and the success of the radical pair mechanism in explaining\r\nmagnetic field effects in photosynthetic reaction centers. The radical pair mechanism\r\n(as detailed in Chapter 2) occurs when a pair of radicals forms a cage radical pair,\r\na system composed of two unpaired electron spins whose spin motion is affected by\r\nnearby nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction, by applied magnetic fields via the\r\nZeeman effect, and by each other via the exchange and dipole interactions. The spin\r\nmotion varies in singlet/triplet character, and if the chemical reaction is more (or less)\r\nfavorable in a singlet/triplet state, the reaction rate can depend on applied magnetic\r\nfields, even ones very weak and near earth-strength.\r\nTo approach the above goal, during my graduate work I have developed and published\r\nseveral new perturbation treatments for combinations of steady and oscillating\r\nmagnetic fields in the radical pair mechanism: one based on the Schri::idinger Equation\r\n(see [4, 5] or Chapter 3), another based on the Liouville Equation (see [6] or\r\nChapter 4), and two more mixed perturbation methods that bridge the gap between\r\nthe Schri::idinger and Liouville formalisms (see Chapter 5). All of these iterative approaches\r\ncan be used to calculate singlet-to-triplet yields when the strength of the\r\noscillating magnetic field is weak compared to the other terms in the spin Hamiltonian.\r\nThis range occurs both in the natural magnetic environment (where oscillating fields\r\ntend to be smaller than 0.03 G and steady fields tend to be near 0.5 G) and in many\r\nman-made environments. Thus, these perturbation treatments should be applicable\r\nboth in studies of magnetic sensory mechanisms in animals and in studies of health\r\neffects of electromagnetic fields. These perturbation methods also allow much faster\r\ncalculation of singlet-to-triplet yields than do numerical integration methods and are more generally applicable than the rotating frame treatment, allowing treatment of\r\nanisotropic spin Hamiltonians and treatment of multiple oscillating fields at any orientation\r\nwith respect to the steady field. Finally, the different perturbation methods\r\ncomplement each other; that is, the Liouville Equation method yields a more efficient\r\nand reliable computer algorithm while the Schrodinger Equation method yields more\r\ninsight into how effects of steady and oscillating magnetic fields occur and can more\r\neasily be used to generate analytical expressions for field and frequency dependences of\r\nsinglet-to-triplet yields. Also, while the Liouville formalism allows one to calculate effects\r\non steady and oscillating field sensitivity of different escape rates (ks and kr) for\r\nsinglet and triplet pairs and can be generalized to include relaxation, the Schrodinger\r\nformalism lets one treat both exponential and Noyes time-dependences. Together\r\nthese new methods can be quite useful for studying biological effects of oscillating\r\nmagnetic fields, and their sample results show a number of behaviors in the singletto-\r\ntriplet yields (such as saturation effects, oscillating field strength and frequency\r\nresonances, and steady field strength- and orientation- dependent frequency shifts)\r\nthat, while typical in quantum mechanics or magnetic resonance, seem surprising in\r\nbiology and may account for conflicts in the magnetic field bioeffects literature.\r\nAlso during my graduate work I have used EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance)\r\ndata for the cage radical pairs formed by the homolytic cleavage of Co-C bonds\r\nin several coenzyme B12 dependent enzymes to calculate effects of earth-strength\r\nsteady and oscillating magnetic fields on their singlet-to-triplet yields via the radical\r\npair mechanism (see [7] or Chapter 6). Energy level repulsions and the state-mixing\r\nthey induce are found to be very important for determining overall sizes of effects and\r\nlower bounds on oscillating-field frequencies that can cause effects in such systems.\r\nB12 and similar systems with nearly axial zero-field spin Hamiltonians, dominated by\r\nterms over 100 times larger than Zeeman terms due to earth-strength steady fields,\r\nif under relatively immobile conditions of long lifetime, slow molecular tumbling, and\r\nslow spin relaxation, may be useful as biological sensors of both steady and oscillating\r\nfields that occur in nature, since the yields calculated show sensitivity to steady\r\nfield strength (even after powder averaging) and orientation, and undergo steadyfield-\r\ndependent shifts in the oscillating-field frequencies of maximal effect. Thus,\r\nsince B12 is used by a number of enzymes (including ribonucleotide reductase, which\r\nconverts RNA to DNA nucleotides; methyl malonyl CoA mutase, which controls the\r\nmetabolism of certain fatty acids in mammals; and methionine synthase, which in\r\nmammals is used to regenerate active methyl groups on S-adenosyl methionine, which\r\nis involved in DNA methylation, melatonin and epinephrine synthesis, myelination, and methylation of chemotaxis proteins) and since some of these B12-dependent processes\r\nhave been reported to be influenced by magnetic fields, coenzyme B12 may be\r\nan interesting candidate target for magnetic field effects in biology.U of I Onlydissertation/thesi", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/30772", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586088953000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511795000, "depositedDate": 1458197024000}, "subjects": ["text", "dissertation/thesis"], "title": "Approaching magnetic field effects in biology using the radical pair mechanism", "topics": ["magnetic field", "biology", "radical pair mechanism", "schrodinger equation", "Liouville Equation", "electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)", "biological radical systems", "biological bagnetic field effects"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/30772", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291779433", "authors": ["Siuti, Nertila"], "contributors": ["Kelleher, Neil L."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "132 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.We have also developed a top down-like approach (middle down) which analyzes large peptides to characterize PTM profiles on histone H3.

Recently, a new fluorescence technique called fluorescence imaging with one nanometer accuracy (FIONA) was shown to localize the position of a fluorescent molecule within a nanometer. Using FIONA, we examined photophysical properties of ReAsH - a novel fluorescent molecule. We showed that ReAsH is more photostable and brighter than eGFP, indicating that ReAsH can be used for in vivo tracking and localization of specific proteins. We also have used FIONA to study myosin VI, the only myosin to move in a direction opposite that of other myosins. This reverse directionality enables myosin VI to be involved in endocytosis. We investigated its structural and functional mechanisms. First, we discovered the stepping mechanism of myosin VI. By placing fluorescent molecules in two different positions and using FIONA, we showed that myosin VI walks hand-over-hand. Second, we revealed the dimerization mechanism of myosin VI. We demonstrated that myosin VI can be dimerized by clustering monomers through binding them either to actin or to antibodies, which implies that cargo-binding induces the dimerization of myosin VI inside cells. Third, we showed that the 53 amino acids unique to myosin VI (the unique insert) determine its directionality. We constructed several chimeric myosins with or without the unique insert, and tested them with gliding assay, which showed that the unique insert causes reverse directionality. Using FIONA, we found that it has a broad distribution similar to that of myosin VI, suggesting that the converter domain is the source of its highly variable step size. Fourth, we measured the processivity of myosin VI at different temperatures, and found that the average step size was smaller at higher temperatures, suggesting that the lever arm becomes less rigid at higher temperatures. Circular dichroism spectrum confirmed a structural change at &sim;30&deg;C. We found that additional ADP increases the run-length of myosin VI, implying that the preference of myosin VI for ADP and competition between ADP and ATP for catalytic sites prevents myosin VI from detaching from actin and allows it to walk long distances.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/84250", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089427000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512017000, "depositedDate": 1458204877000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Single-Molecule Fluorescence Studies of ReAsH and Myosin VI", "topics": ["Biophysics, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/84250", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291778169", "authors": ["Best, Aaron Addison"], "contributors": ["Olsen, Gary J."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "169 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2001.Comparative analyses are at the core of modern biology, providing insight into the evolution of life and specific cellular systems. This thesis analyzes transcription systems in Archaea and Eucarya in an effort to understand the evolution of this fundamental cellular process. Projects span from analyses of the archaeal RNA polymerase to a unique genome survey of transcription components in an early-diverging eukaryote. It is apparent that the evolution of transcriptional machinery can be subdivided into the evolution of a core system and the evolution of a peripheral set of factors modulating the activity and specificity of the core. We see the core in the similarity of RNA polymerases and modes of initiation between Archaea and Eucarya; through protein-protein interaction studies, we demonstrated that the RNA polymerases from each domain adopt a similar architecture. We see the periphery in an analysis of the genome of Giardia lamblia, highlighting the divergence of transcription systems during the early evolution of Eucarya. During the survey, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) from Giardia lamblia was observed to be highly degenerate relative to all known TBPs. Comparative modeling of giardial TBP with eukaryotic TBP crystal structures reveals altered binding surfaces for interactions with DNA and transcription factors. A comparative analysis of post-transcriptional modification of RNA in the three domains of life illustrates the uniqueness of each domain. It is likely that Archaea do not modify RNA by post-transcriptional polyadenylation, a process adopted for disparate functions in both the bacterial and eukaryal domains.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/86633", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089450000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512028000, "depositedDate": 1458219157000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Evolution of Transcription in Archaea and the Early-Diverging Eukaryote, Giardia Lamblia", "topics": ["Biology, Molecular"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/86633", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291776905", "authors": ["Toth, Amy Lynn"], "contributors": ["Robinson, Gene E."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "139 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2006.This thesis describes research aimed at understanding the mechanisms and evolution of sociality in colony-forming insects. I first summarize a conceptual framework for the study of social behavior inspired by the field of evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\"); I suggest complex social behavior evolves via co-option of mechanisms underlying basic forms of solitary behavior, such as feeding and reproduction. Next, I describe research with honey bees (Apis mellifera) to determine whether division of labor between workers is related to individual nutritional status. I found that bees performing foraging behavior have half the abdominal lipid stores of hive-workers. Then, I demonstrated experimental lipid depletion causes early onset of foraging, suggesting that a change in nutritional status can have a causal influence on behavior. Additionally, my results show that social interactions between workers are necessary for bees to attain high lipid stores as found in hive-workers, but that social interactions and nutrition act independently to influence foraging ontogeny. Because a nutritionally-depleted foraging force characterizes many social insect species, I investigated whether the nutritional mechanism and other molecular pathways influencing division of labor are conserved in an insect with independently evolved sociality, the paper wasp Polistes metricus. I also found low abdominal lipid in P. metricus foragers. I then developed an EST project of sequences representing approximately 5000 P. metricus genes. I examined the expression of a set of 32 P. metricus orthologs to genes known from previous studies to be associated with foraging behavior in worker honey bees. I found that expression of this set of genes differed significantly between P. metricus females in distinct behavioral castes. Expression patterns of individual wasps were predictive of behavioral state with a high (up to 80%) rate of success. In addition, I found 34% of genes to be associated with differences in wasp foraging state. In summary, I have demonstrated shared patterns of physiological and molecular regulation of social organization in two species with widely different forms of sociality. These results suggest several shared mechanisms underlying multiple origins of sociality and hint at the existence of a shared genetic \"toolkit\" for the evolution of social organization.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/85368", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089437000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512022000, "depositedDate": 1458217672000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Comparative Physiological and Genomic Analyses of Division of Labor in Honey Bees and Paper Wasps", "topics": ["Biology, Neuroscience"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/85368", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291718006", "authors": ["Whitis, Judith Davidson"], "contributors": ["Madsen, A."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "This study investigated the nature and frequency of writing tasks undertaken by students in colleges and universities granting bachelor's degrees in institutions accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.

The response rate of the survey was 309/450 or 69.0% with each of the six subject areas recording response rates exceeding 60.0%. Questions on the survey were grouped into categories that related to the study's ten research questions: (1) class and instructor characteristics, (2) writing and related activities, (3) reasons for writing, (4) longer writing assignments, (5) intellectual uses of writing, (6) teaching techniques, (7) audiences for student writing, (8) responses to student writing, (9) length of writing assignments, (10) time allowed for writing assignments. The survey also included a section in which respondents answered questions and expressed their views on student writing.Overall, results indicated that writing occurs across subject areas in colleges, most frequently in the forms of note-taking, discursive writing of a paragraph or longer, and short-answer responses. College instructors stress application of subject area concepts and subject area information more than development of writing skills and personal experience. Informational uses of writing dominate student writing with personal and imaginative uses occurring infrequently. Prewriting, writing and revising, and postwriting techniques are used only sparingly in content classes. College instructors' responses are related to students' thinking processes, accuracy of conclusions, and organization. Subject area instructors accept joint responsibility with freshman writing instructors for teaching students to write, and they feel adequately prepared to do it. Most college instructors have not heard of the writing process movement, but most have heard of the writing across the curriculum movement.Additional conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made.

This thesis described studies carried out to further our understanding of genes whose expression is altered by the level of dietary fat. The experimental approach was designed to obtain basic information in virgin female mice whose responses to dietary fat were not confounded by the production of a mammary tumor virus, hormonal events of pregnancy or the use of a chemical carcinogen. I have used molecular biology techniques to identify genes regulated by different levels of dietary fat. cDNA libraries were constructed from mammary tissue of virgin female Balb/c mice (7wks) fed a fat free diet for one week and then switched to either a 3 or 20% corn oil (co) diet for 2 wks. Subtractive hybridization of the lowfat cDNA library revealed genes expressed preferentially by mice fed the 3% co diet. These clones are designated lowfat mammary 1 and 2 (LFM-1, LFM-2). The diet regulated LFM-1 is a homolog to an UV-inducible gene. Since DNA repair enzymes are also induced by UV-irradiation, the identification of this single gene suggests that genes involved in DNA repair also may be regulated by dietary fat. Regulation of DNA repair genes by different levels of dietary fat may provide the first experimental link between the high fat diet and promotion of specific diseases.The second diet-specific cDNA, LFM-2, had homology to stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) which is the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids from acetyl-CoA in animal tissues. The regulation of SCD by dietary fat is not well understood at this time. The physiological importance of SCD is probably related to the production of oleic acid which is the major fatty acid constituent in mouse depot fat. In conclusion, the data presented in this thesis showed that different levels of dietary fat as 3 and 20% corn oil, can modulate the expression of specific genes. The identification of diet regulated genes will be useful in gaining understanding of the influence of macronutrients on tissue physiology and development.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23591", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586088891000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511767000, "depositedDate": 1305268752000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Molecular analyses of differences in gene expression due to changes in the level of dietary fat", "topics": ["Biology, Molecular", "Health Sciences, Nutrition"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23591", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "15564608", "authors": ["Cunha, Marina R.", "Paterson, Gordon L.

Discovery, 2005) CD179 (R.R.S. Charles Darwin, 2006) and 64PE252 (R.V. Pelagia, 2006). The taxonomic composition and patterns in biodiversity, abundance and community structure of the\r\nbenthic macrofauna were described. Annelida(42.1% of total abundance; 137 species) and Arthropoda (20.6%; 162 species) were, respectively, the most abundant and the most species-rich Phyla among the 342 taxa identified during this study. Multivariate analyses showed significant differences between and within canyons and between canyons and open slope assemblages. At their upper section, canyons supported higher macrofauna abundance but slightly lower biodiversity than the adjacent slopes at similar depth. In all canyons abundance reached the highest value in the middle section and the lowest in the upper section, with marked fluctuations in Nazar\u00e9 (474\u20134599 ind.m2) and lower variability in Cascais (583\u20131125 ind.m2). The high abundance and dominance of the assemblages in the middle section of Nazar\u00e9 and Set\u00fabal was accompanied by depressed biodiversity, while in Cascais, Hurlbert\u2019s expected species richnes sshowed increasing values from theupper to the middle canyon, and maintained the high values at the lower section. Overall, the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon showed the lowest expected species richness (ES(100): 16\u201339) and the Cascais Canyon the highest(39\u201354). There was a significant negative Kendall\u2019s correlation between total organic carbon concentrations in the superficial sediments and ES(100) and a significant positive correlation between total nitrogen and macrofauna density. The influences oforganic enrichment, sediment heterogeneity and hydrodynamic regime on the abundance, diversity and community structure of the macrofauna are discussed. It is suggested that altered and localised environmental conditions in the Portuguese canyons play an important role in modifying more common abundance and diversity bathymetric patterns evident in many continental slope environments.European Commission - GOCE-CT-2005-511234HERMIONE - 226354FCT - SFRH/BPD/21459/2005FCT - SFRH/BPD/22383/2005FCT - SFRH/BD/16563/2004FCT - SFRH/BD/17085/2004HERMES projec", "identifiers": ["oai:ria.ua.pt:10773/4452", "10.1016/j.dsr2.2011.04.007"], "journals": [{"title": "Deep Sea Research Part II Topical Studies in Oceanography", "identifiers": ["issn:0967-0645", "0967-0645"]}], "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "relations": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2011.04.007"], "repositories": [{"id": "580", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Reposit\u00f3rio Institucional da Universidade de Aveiro", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1378220831000, "metadataUpdated": 1608478624000, "depositedDate": 1337209200000}, "subjects": ["article"], "title": "Biodiversity of macrofaunal assemblages from three Portuguese submarine canyons (NE Atlantic)", "topics": ["Submarine canyons", "Biodiversity", "Macrofauna", "Deep-sea", "Environmental conditions"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/15564608.pdf", "doi": "10.1016/j.dsr2.2011.04.007", "oai": "oai:ria.ua.pt:10773/4452", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/15564608.pdf"}, {"id": "132282713", "authors": ["Almeida, Salom\u00e9 Fernandes Pinheiro de"], "contributors": [], "description": "Doutoramento em BiologiaNo curso inferior de alguns dos rios pertencentes \u00e0 bacia hidr\u00f3gr\u00e1fica do rio Vouga e em tr\u00eas valas de reconhecida import\u00e2ncia para a rega dos f\u00e9rteis terrenos adjacentes, localizaram-se\r\ndezoito esta\u00e7\u00f5es de amostragem que foram, durante cerca de um ano e meio, estudadas com uma periodicidade aproximadamente mensa1.

Strong solvent signals lead to a disappearance of weak resonances of interest close to the solvent artifact and to base plane variations all over the spectrum. The AUREMOL-SSA/ALS approach for automated solvent artifact removal and baseline correction has been originally developed for multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Here, we describe the necessary adaptations for an automated application to one-dimensional NMR spectra. Its core algorithm is still based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) applied on time domain signals (FIDs) and it is still combined with an automated baseline correction (ALS) in the frequency domain. However, both steps (SSA and ALS) have been modified in order to achieve optimal results when dealing with one-dimensional spectra. The performance of the method has been tested on one-dimensional synthetic and experimental spectra including the back-calculated spectrum of HPr protein and an experimental spectrum of a human urine sample. The latter has been recorded with the typically used NOESY-type 1D pulse sequence including water pre-saturation. Furthermore, the fully automated AUREMOL-SSA/ALS procedure includes the managing of oversampled, digitally filtered and zero-filled data and the correction of the frequency domain phase shift caused by the group delay time shift from the digital finite response filtering.Bavarian Science Foundation (ForNeuroCell)European Union (SPINE-2)Fonds of the Chemical Industry (FCI", "identifiers": ["oai:ria.ua.pt:10773/5301", "10.1016/j.jmr.2011.03.001"], "journals": [{"title": "Journal of Magnetic Resonance", "identifiers": ["issn:1090-7807", "1090-7807"]}], "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "relations": ["http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WJX-52B11B1-1/2/01bbacbb91d0a152d62d8dacdf8b086a"], "repositories": [{"id": "580", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Reposit\u00f3rio Institucional da Universidade de Aveiro", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1378220834000, "metadataUpdated": 1608478637000, "depositedDate": 1337209200000}, "subjects": ["article"], "title": "Singular spectrum analysis for an automated solvent artifact removal and baseline correction of 1D NMR spectra", "topics": ["AUREMOL-SSA/ALS", "Singular Spectrum Analysis", "Solvent suppression", "Baseline correction", "Oversampled digitally filtered data", "Group delay", "Finite response filter"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "doi": "10.1016/j.jmr.2011.03.001", "oai": "oai:ria.ua.pt:10773/5301", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "83600862", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9, M\u00f3nica Jo\u00e3o de Barros Amorim"], "contributors": ["Soares, Amadeu", "R\u00f6mbke, J\u00f6rg"], "description": "Doutoramento em BiologiaSoil ecotoxicology studies are usually performed in standard soils, such as\r\nOECD artificial soil or LUFA, a natural soil.

For this reason, it is a priority to develop methods to evaluate the degree of exposure and contamination of estuarine natural populations in order to minimise the impact of human activities.\r\nBiomarkers have been widely used in ecotoxicology as early warning signals of chemicals effects, offering the possibility of anticipating severe alterations at a population level and, thus, making possible a protective intervention. Among the biomarkers potentially available for use, in this study attention was focused on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), alterations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and induction of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the monooxygenase enzymes associated to P450 system (P450), which have been shown to be appropriate for use in a large variety of species and real scenarios.\r\nThe aim of the present work was to develop a battery of biomarkers on natural populations of Pomatoschistus microps (Kr\u00f8yer, 1838) in order to assess the effect of environmental contaminants in estuaries from the Atlantic Iberian coast. For this purpose three studies with distinct objectives were carried out: (i) characterization of the cholinesterase forms present in head tissues of P. microps; (ii) identification in P. micropsof suitable biomarkers to assess the environmental contaminant 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA); (iii) assessment of different contamination impacts in estuaries of the Norwest Portuguese coast using the selected biomarkers.\r\nExposure to DCA induced important alterations at histological and biochemical levels, that indicate this compound as potentially toxic for natural populations of P. micropsin estuaries with agricultural influence. The results obtained with the assessment of environmental contamination support the usefulness of the biomarker approach at different levels of biological organization to assess the toxicity of environmental pollution, and provide further support for the use of P. microps as a biomonitor in estuaries of the Iberian coast", "identifiers": ["oai:ria.ua.pt:10773/19065", null], "publisher": "Universidade de Aveiro", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "580", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Reposit\u00f3rio Institucional da Universidade de Aveiro", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1512222717000, "metadataUpdated": 1608478744000, "depositedDate": 1530486000000}, "subjects": ["masterThesis"], "title": "Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da toxicidade de contaminantes ambientais em popula\u00e7\u00f5es naturais de Pomatoschistus microps (Kr\u00f8yer, 1938)", "topics": ["Zonas costeiras - Contamina\u00e7\u00e3o", "Ecossistemas estuarinos - Contamina\u00e7\u00e3o", "Ecotoxicologia", "M\u00e9todos biomoleculares"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/132282905.pdf", "oai": "oai:ria.ua.pt:10773/19065", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/132282905.pdf"}, {"id": "32244476", "authors": ["Lucas, Margarida", "Cabrita, Isabel", "Ferreira, Adriana"], "contributors": [], "description": "After more than 400 years of Portuguese colonization and a 24-year period of Indonesian occupation, Timor-Leste became a fully independent state on May 20, 2012.

The current methods to investigate the heterogeneous nature of cancer are inadequate, since they rely on 2D cell cultures and animal models. The cell line-based drug efficacy and toxicity assays are not able to predict the tumor response to anti-cancer agents and it is already widely discussed how molecular pathway are not recapitulated\u00c2\u00a0in vitro\u00c2\u00a0so called flat biology. On the other side, animal models often fail to detect the side-effects of drugs, mimic the metastatic progression or the interaction between cancer and immune system, due to biologic difference in human and animals. Moreover, ethical and regulatory issues limit animal experimentation. Every year pharma/biotech companies lose resources in drug discovery and testing processes that are successful only in 5% of the cases. There is an urgent need to validate accurate and predictive platforms in order to enhance drug-testing process taking into account the physiopathology of the tumor microenvironment. Three dimensional\u00c2\u00a0in vitro\u00c2\u00a0tumor models could enhance drug manufactures in developing effective drugs for cancer diseases. The 3D\u00c2\u00a0in vitro\u00c2\u00a0cancer models can improve the predictability of toxicity and drug sensitivity in cancer. Despite the demonstrated advantages of 3D\u00c2\u00a0in vitro\u00c2\u00a0disease systems when compared to 2D culture and animal models, they still do not reach the standardization required for preclinical trials.

Despite the attention given to and the controversy engendered by the biology of these flies, both by applied entomologists concerned with the flies' status as agricultural pests and by evolutionary biologists interested in modes of speciation, this is the first study to provide substantial support for genetic differentiation for traits important in host selection and in maintenance of reproductive isolation among these sibling species and host-associated populations.Interspecific or interpopulational crosses have demonstrated three levels of partial barriers to hybridization. First, a measure of temporal isolation among host-associated populations is afforded by genetic control of seasonal divergence in post-diapause eclosion patterns. Second, the combined effects of the use of (a) the host plant as a rendezvous site for mating and (b) genetic differences among these flies for oviposition response to actual host fruits and to artificial fruits of different sizes limit the opportunity for encounter between flies from different populations. Third, even if interspecific encounters occur, differences in mating response and egg hatch success further reduce the potential for introgression.It is essential to emphasize that, while these factors must be important in maintaining reproductive isolation among these sibling species or host-associated populations of the R. pomonella group, it should not be concluded from this study that these factors were responsible for the divergence and subsequent speciation. Therefore, these results should not be construed as evidence in direct support of the hypothesis of sympatric speciation by these host-associated fruit flies.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/71102", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1432659668000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008972000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Genetics and Reproductive Isolation of Rhagoletis Flies (Fruit Fly, Eclosion, Speciation, Electrophoresis, Host Selection)", "topics": ["Biology, Entomology"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/71102", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158303553", "authors": ["Martin, Hector Garcia"], "contributors": ["Nigel Goldenfeld"], "description": "216 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2004.I have also used Path Integral Monte Carlo techniques to explore the limit of rapid rotations, where the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is no longer valid.

It was from localities around these shores\r\nthat a long whaling tradition started in the XI century. For more than 600 hundred years the Right whale was\r\ncaught along these coasts until the decline of whaling in the XVIII century. Modem whaling started in Spain at\r\nthe beginning of the XX century in the Gibraltar Straits. In the second half of the century whaling activity\r\ncontinued in the north west of the Iberian Peninsula. The target species were sperm and fin whale. The interest\r\nin cetacean studies on the Spanish coast goes back to the XVIII century with the works of pioneers such as\r\nSarmiento and Comide and continued with the monographic works by Graells and Cabrera. Since the last quarter\r\nof the past century an extraordinary boom in the number of studies on cetaceans in the Bay of Biscay has taken\r\nplace. About thirty cetacean species ha ve been reported in the Bay of Biscay, seven belonging to Mysticeti and\r\ntwenty three to Odontoceti. Precise knowledge on the biology, distribution and migratory pattems are restricted\r\nto some of them whilst absolute abundance estimations are lacking for the majority of the species. Further\r\nresearch is needed in these areas. One of the main concems for the conservation of cetacean populations in the\r\nBay of Biscay is the interaction with fisheries. Other threats are related to the degradation of the marine\r\nenvironment due to chemical waste and the increase in noise pollution. Several conventions deal with the\r\nmanagement and conservation of cetaceans.

Therefore, in order to ensure their contribution to the germline, PGCs must retained their migration capacity after thawing, and in most cases host embryo/larva should be sterilized to avoid endogenous contribution to the germ line. Several cryopreservation and vitrification protocols have been proposed in different species and genetic and epigenetic studies have been performed in order to analyze the effect of freezing/thawing in these cells.

Most participants were between 18 and 21 years old (64%) and were women (78.5%). Participants were asked to self-identify their race and approximately one-third [27% (n=56)] reported their race as White, and only 10.2% (n=21) reported their race as Black. Most self-reported their skin color as a lighter shade (89% rated their skin color between 1 and 4) and 31.2% (n=64) reported their skin color as \"2=very light\". Only 10.8% (n=22) reported their skin color as 5 and above (darker skin color). Approximately one-quarter reported their parent's country of origin is Mexico 24.9% (n=51) and others reported their parent's country of origin is the United States of America (15.1% n=31), or various countries in Latin America (e.g., Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Honduras, Cuba) and European Countries (e.g., Scotland, Spain, Ireland, Hungary). More than half were single when they completed the survey (58.5%), 39% were in a relationship, and 2.9% were married. Approximately, 70% reported they spoke another language while growing up; 64.9% reported speaking Spanish. Most were in college when they completed the survey (68.8% n=141). More than half reported their annual income as less than $10,000 (n=138; 67.3%) and approximately half reported their family's social economic status as working class (43.9%). Participants first completed a demographic questionnaire and then 5 valid and reliable self-report surveys to examine their skin color, racial identity, perceived racial discrimination, parental racial socialization, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Results suggest that racial identity, specifically the self-hatred and anti-dominant stages of the cross identity stages of development, and not skin color or parental racial socialization is a significant mediator between perceived racial discrimination and self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Participants who perceived more racial discrimination and who were in the self-hatred stage tended to report more depressive symptoms (partial mediation). Results of the second mediation analysis suggest that the self-hatred and anti-dominant scales are significantly associated with lower self-esteem and is a fully mediated model because the racial discrimination path was not significant. Thus, for USA born Latinos who report experiencing racial discrimination, the more grounded in self-hatred or anti-dominant identities, the lower their self-esteem and the more depressive symptoms they tend to experience. This is a noteworthy finding which supports Cross's (1991) racial identity development. Results also suggest that parental socialization towards equality despite racial differences is a significant predictor of higher self-esteem and less depressive symptoms. This dissertation study has important implications for family therapists who are working with young adult USA born Latinos. First, more comprehensive clinical assessments should be done to better understand Latinos' experiences of racial discrimination, racial identity, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Clinicians should focus on the importance of parental socialization toward equality, in particular when Latino youth report experiencing discrimination, depressive symptoms, and lower self-esteem. In future research studies, two or more racial identity models should be used to capture the diverse ways Latinos tend to racially identify in the USA. Studies should also be designed to prospectively evaluate the importance of racial identity development over time from childhood to young adulthood to better understand Latino mental health and well-being in order to develop culturally sensitive family prevention programs for parents and youth.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6135", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028715000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Latino Skin Color: The Role of Discrimination, Racial identity, and Parental racial Socialization on Self Esteem and Depression", "topics": ["Family Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201411, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190334543.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6135", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190334543.pdf"}, {"id": "190322343", "authors": ["Radl, Donna M."], "contributors": ["Bradt, Joke"], "description": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy intervention on emotional distress and psychological well-being in female cancer patients. Assessing and treating patients\u2019 unmet emotional needs is a national focus in oncology care today. The intervention provided patients with an opportunity to portray their feelings and identify coping skills artistically through a creative process. Art therapy is based on the theory that the human mind tends to experience intrusive and avoidant stress response symptoms when faced with adverse events, such as a life-threatening illness. Creative expression can help patients reintegrate their sense of self and strengthen personal attributes. To evaluate the intervention, a repeated measures randomized controlled trial design was employed. Sixty consenting women were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the six-session Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy intervention group or the standard care control group. Results suggest that Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy may help decrease emotional distress and enhance spiritual well-being in female cancer patients during active oncology treatment. Positive trends in the data were present, but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups for the two main variables. Small treatment effects were found for Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy on participants\u2019 psychological well-being. However, one subscale measure revealed statistically significant greater improvements in Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy participants\u2019 spiritual wellbeing compared to the standard care control participants.

David"], "description": "Common medical management for breast cancer (BC) most often includes lumpectomy and radiation (LR) or mastectomy and reconstruction (MR).  Due to these procedures involving the shoulder, it is not surprising that some women experience shoulder complex motion and coordination problems. However, the long-term effect that BC treatments have on shoulder complex motion and coordination during functional tasks is not well understood.  The rationale for impaired shoulder complex motion and coordination among women with BC is that these women frequently experience impairments that are believed to contribute to these problems including soft tissue pain, decreased shoulder complex muscle strength, decreased tissue flexibility, altered resting scapular alignment (RSA), and lymphedema. However, limited research exists to support this notion. Therefore, the aims of this dissertation were 1) determine the effect that breast cancer treatments (LR and MR) have on shoulder complex motion and coordination, 2) identify clinical factors associated with impaired shoulder complex coordination in women with a history of breast cancer treatment.  Scapular and humeral kinematic data and clinical measures of pain, RSA, tissue flexibility, strength and lymphedema were collected on 30 women with BC (mean age \u00b1 SD = 53.8 \u00b1 10.9 yrs.) and 30 women without BC (mean age \u00b1 SD = 52.7 \u00b1 10.8 yrs.). Separate one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were conducted to determine whether differences in shoulder complex motion existed between groups (p < .05). Angle-angle and relative motion graphs were created for 3 scapular and 2 clavicular rotations. Mean curves with 95% minimal detectable change bands (MDCB) were calculated using data from women without BC. Each woman with BC\u2019s curve was individually compared to the mean curve and MDCB. Women with BC were classified as having normal (curve fell within MDCB) or impaired shoulder complex coordination (curve fell outside MDCB).  Discriminant analyses were used to identify clinical variables that could classify women as having normal or impaired shoulder complex coordination (p < .05).  There were no significant differences in shoulder complex motion between women with and without BC or between those with different medical management (LR, MR). Over 93% of women with BC demonstrated impaired shoulder complex coordination for at least 1 scapular or clavicular rotation. Discriminant analysis revealed that clinical measures of pain, RSA, tissue flexibility, strength, and lymphedema were associated with impaired shoulder complex coordination.  Cross-validated classification showed that 43.4% to 73.3% of women were grouped correctly.  Failure to find group differences in motion may be due to the fact that women in our study were relatively high functioning and recovered from their medical management.  Additionally, the majority of women in our study were previously educated on a home exercise program (73.3%) and attended physical therapy (56.7%). A lack of significant differences in shoulder complex motion between women with and without a BC suggests that the women in our study had sufficient range of motion to accomplish the functional tasks. Although we did not find differences in motion between women with and without BC across functional tasks, the majority women with BC demonstrated impaired shoulder complex coordination. Clinical measures of tissue flexibility (ROM and pectoralis minor length) were associated with impaired shoulder complex coordination across multiple scapular and clavicular rotations.Ph.D., Rehabilitation Sciences -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6684", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028580000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343046000, "depositedDate": 1551352849000}, "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "title": "Shoulder Complex Motion and Coordination Impairments, and the Associated Clinical Factors in Women with a History of Breast Cancer Treatment", "topics": ["Physical therapy", "Shoulder joint", "Physical Therapy Modalities"], "types": [], "year": 201512, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190328839.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6684", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190328839.pdf"}, {"id": "190330699", "authors": ["Enuameh, Yeetey Akpe Kwesi"], "contributors": ["Ulmer, Lisa"], "description": "Background -- The younger generation is the wealth and future of humanity; their health and wellbeing deserve utmost attention. Adolescent Friendly Health Services (AFHS) aim at providing accessible, developmentally appropriate and comprehensive evidence based promotional, preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative health care to adolescents via well trained professionals and well equipped health facilities. This study sought to explore adherence of health facilities in Ghana to the World Health Organization (WHO) AFHS concept. The study also identified obstacles the facilities faced in implementing the program, innovative measures taken to overcome them and any other approaches to enhance AFHS delivery to the adolescent population. Methods -- Using a cross sectional (observational) study design with a multi informant, mixed method survey, the study assessed adherence to AFHS criteria among health facilities providing AFHS oriented care in the Akwapim North and South Districts of Ghana. Results -- Health facilities identified as early adopters had significantly higher AFHS implementation compared to late adopters, and the association of adopter category with AFHS implementation did not vary by location (urban vs. rural). Organizational characteristics of clinical care infrastructure, logistics monitoring, and capacity building, were significantly associated with implementation. Major barriers to AFHS implementation included care provider attitude/behavior towards adolescents, community attitudes about adolescents receiving sexual and reproductive health services like family planning, and health care costs (affecting adolescents and health facilities). Conclusions -- The Ghana Ministry of Health initiative to transform the system towards AFHS appears to be successful, as early adopters have higher rates of implementation than late adopters, but it is important to note that a transformation of this nature takes time. The change towards AFHS implementation is supported by organizational changes to clinical care infrastructure, logistics monitoring, and capacity building, suggesting that the addition of a training and technical assistance program may speed the change process. Finally, while facility structure and process issues are important for transforming the Ghana Healthy System towards AFHS, it appears that successful transformation also depends, in part, upon provider and community attitudes, available resources for work, and health care policies related to costs, highlighting the importance of working with health care professional organizations, community leaders, and other stakeholders to institute full system-wide change.Dr.P.H., Public Health -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6131", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028628000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Transforming the System of Care for Adolescents in Ghana: Preliminary Investigation of Adolescent Friendly Health Services Implementation in Two Administrative Districts of the Ghana Health Service", "topics": ["Public Health"], "types": [], "year": 201305, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190330699.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6131", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190330699.pdf"}, {"id": "190322483", "authors": ["Johnson, Kristen Melissa"], "contributors": ["Welles, Seth"], "description": "Given similar routes of exposure, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection is common among HIV-positive populations. The long-term impact of these is becoming an important public health concern, given the high rates of co-exposure coupled with increased AIDS-related survival and widespread accessibility of antiretroviral therapy. Using a population drawn from an urban HIV clinic, we investigated prevalence rates of co-exposure, and identified factors associated with co-exposure, sexual transmission of HCV, and HCV viral clearance using a cross-sectional study design on data collected from 2002-11. We also conducted survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards regressions to model the risk of progression to four outcomes (clinical AIDS, all-cause mortality, HIV virologic failure, and decline in CD4 count) based on HBV and HCV status.  Among 2,880 HIV-positive subjects, relatively high seroprevalences of HBV (44%), HCV (34%), and HBV/HCV (19%) was observed. Injection drug users (IDUs) had the greatest odds of each co-exposure. Additionally, race, sex, socioeconomic status, older age, and more recent HIV diagnosis were associated with co-exposure. Sexual transmission of HCV was associated with Black race, younger age, and a more recent HIV diagnosis Among subjects with a history of HCV exposure, 13% had evidence of HCV viral clearance; being HBV surface antigen-positive was highly predictive of clearance. In the survival analysis, HBV status negatively affected HIV disease progression, particularly time to clinical AIDS and HIV virologic failure. Additionally, HCV status may be related to faster progression to clinical AIDS and all-cause mortality.  Taken together, our findings highlight the burden of viral hepatitis co-infections among HIV-positive individuals, and the need to reduce this burden through routine testing, HBV vaccination, and appropriate therapy. Further research, particularly with a prospective study design, is warranted to fully understand the factors associated with viral hepatitis co-infection among HIV-positive populations. Identification of those more likely to develop chronic HCV infections can inform therapy decisions. Further, given the relatively high rates of HBV and HCV co-infection and the current debate on their impact on HIV disease progression, additional research is needed to further elucidate these relationships.Ph.D., Epidemiology -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6729", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028451000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343090000, "depositedDate": 1551352852000}, "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "title": "Epidemiology of HIV-1 and hepatitis virus co-infection: Distribution and pathogenesis in an urban clinic population", "topics": ["Public Health", "Epidemiology", "HIV-1", "Hepatitis"], "types": [], "year": 201212, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322483.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6729", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322483.pdf"}, {"id": "190326292", "authors": ["Mohamad Baba, Zeinab"], "contributors": ["Ulmer, Lisa M."], "description": "Background. Female breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in women (behind lung cancer) (U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group, 2013b). The purpose of this research was to examine client and provider level characteristics driving the disparities in morbidity and mortality as it relates to breast cancer screening, thus providing a clear indication of what client and provider factors are essential for successfully reducing disparities in breast cancer screening beyond removing barriers of cost. Specific aims include: (1) To characterize the client population utilizing the services of the Healthy Woman Program in Pennsylvania; (2) To Identify client and provider predictive factors that influence women with an initial screening mammogram to return for rescreening within 24 months; and (3) To use a local case study to explore service delivery factors influencing woman with an initial screening mammogram to return for rescreening. Methods. This study was a retrospective analysis of prospective data from the Healthy Woman Program (HWP), investigating women enrolled in the HWP in Pennsylvania and their rescreening rates. As the HWP dataset primarily contained client-level variables, additional structural provider-level variables were derived from Komen Foundation data, and data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Census, to extend the investigation beyond the individual woman to specified contextual effects. A local qualitative case study augmented the quantitative analysis to explore more process-oriented contextual effects, with an emphasis on how services are organized to support client outreach and retention, and promising practices for getting clients to return for rescreening. Results. The major predictors of an abnormal mammogram were having a diagnostic mammogram rather than a screening mammogram, being younger than 40, and living in an urban area. The major predictors of a breast cancer diagnosis were being white, being younger than 40, living in a large rural town, and being a current smoker. The major predictors of dropping out after an abnormal mammogram were being white, and having a diagnostic mammogram rather than a screening mammogram. The major predictors of delay in diagnostic work up were Black race and screening mammogram. The major predictors of returning for screening were living in a large rural town, being a non-smoker, having no symptoms prior to the initial mammogram, having a normal result from the initial mammogram, and living with others. Comprehensive breast cancer education, delivered in community settings, and tailored to cultural, social, and literacy issues, results in a robust referral network. More reminders than mandated by HWP Guidance, through multiple channels, rather than the client alone, increase returns for annual rescreening. Conclusions. Prior investigation of rescreening rates among low-income women has focused on client-level factors, yielding a narrow range of targets for systems change. This study investigated both client and provider level characteristics, analyzing them together and separately, to increase understanding of the multifactorial predictors of rescreening and widen the set of potential targets for change. Instituting a protocol of allowing community groups to organize a few women to have screenings in one day and allowing for interpreters who are family or community members would improve rescreening rates. Methods for ensuring patients return should be modified as the HWP sequence may not be enough.Dr.P.H., Public Health -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6724", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028517000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343084000, "depositedDate": 1551352851000}, "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "title": "Examining Disparities in Breast Cancer Screening Rates in a Program Designed to Provide Free Care to Women in the State of Pennsylvania", "topics": ["Public Health"], "types": [], "year": 201405, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190326292.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6724", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190326292.pdf"}, {"id": "190332626", "authors": ["Chilton, Gioia Connell"], "contributors": ["Gerber, Nancy"], "description": "This arts-based research study explored the dynamics of expressing positive emotions, within the intersubjective art making process. The study addressed a multifaceted problem involving a gap in knowledge about the process of emotional expression through art making, which is key to therapeutic action in art therapy. The design was arts-based research, as art making was the primary means of inquiry. The philosophy and methodology of arts-based research were employed to explore the emotional aspects of intersubjective experience. Following the traditions of arts based research, the meaning-making capacity of creating art was used to illuminate the process of artistic creation in response to the research questions. The research was conducted following approval by the Drexel University IRB. Five English-speaking adults who were professional art therapists were recruited as key informants. The method of data generation involved an initial two hour Art Interview, followed by reflexive memoing and responsive art-making by the researcher and a subsequent second Art Interview with co-researchers. Methodological credibility procedures consisted of member checking and peer review. The data analysis processes involved: 1) traditional use of qualitative data analysis practices, such as the use of MAXQDA-10 software for coding for themes and 2) arts-based research data analysis methods. The analysis of the interview data, artistic data, artistic responses and a creative synthesis addressed the research question in the form of visual art pieces, poetry, a video, three stories, four themes, and a theoretical model. Overall, the verbal and artistic analysis of the data resulted in thematic categories that represent the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective art therapy relationship. Based upon the findings, the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective context was conceptualized as an iterative process beginning with metaphors of life and nature, the development of trust, revelations of emotion, empathic responses, reflexivity and joint artmaking creating and causing destabilization, deconstruction, reconstruction, and reimagining of perceptions and meanings. An emerging, holistic view of emotions and the transformative capacity of artmaking in a context of relational trust were discussed.

The limitations of the study were also described, as was methodological criteria for arts-based research. Overall, this expanding discourse helped to identify ways art therapy works.

There are still multiple knowledge gaps regarding HBV in APIs, including information on factors associated with HBV infection and immunity in foreign\u2010born APIs. Particularly in Philadelphia, the epidemiological landscape of chronic HBV infection in high\u2010risk API communities remains largely unknown, making it difficult to develop appropriately targeted interventions. Community\u2010based screening and linkage to care can play an important role in improving low HBV diagnosis rates and generating a more complete understanding of HBV infection in high\u2010risk ethnic communities. However, there are no recommended strategies for addressing HBV infection at the community level, which has limited the success of community\u2010based programs throughout the U.S. This project used a mixed\u2010methods approach to: determine the factors associated with HBV infection and protection (immunity) among APIs in Philadelphia who participated in community\u2010based screening; and to understand the processes, challenges and strategies for conducting enhanced community\u2010based screening and linkage to care. The study included quantitative analysis of survey and seroprevalence data from 2,047 foreign\u2010born and 2nd generation APIs residing in Philadelphia; and qualitative analysis of narratives, focus groups and interviews from two sites that conducted enhanced community\u2010based HBV programming. Controlling for all other variables (at p<0.5), infected individuals in the sample tended to be male, between the ages of 18\u201029, disclosed that they had been previously tested for HBV, had a high school diploma or less, and had either a family member with HBV or HCC, or lived with an infected person; protected individuals in the sample tended to be between the ages of 18\u201029 and born in Korea; susceptible individuals tended to be over age 55, with no family history of HBV, no previous HBV test, and born in a country with no (or a limited) national HBV vaccine program. Not controlling for other variables, being born in China was significantly associated with being linked to care. Results of the qualitative analysis revealed that having a diverse community stakeholder committee was important to the success of enhanced community\u2010based HBV programming. Including stakeholders in all planning stages, and offering ongoing opportunities for training and relationship development helped maintain stakeholder engagement. Limited time, funding, HBV knowledge, bi\u2010lingual resources, and a lack of language capable free health clinics served as challenges to HBV screening, vaccination and linkage to care. Service integration, advanced planning, and having an understanding of community needs were identified strategies to improve programmatic outcomes. Identified challenges with data collection included length of the survey instrument, as well as limited staff time and training needs. The results of this project can be used to guide future community\u2010based interventions in Philadelphia and around the U.S., to successfully improve HBV\u2010related screening, vaccination and linkage to care for high\u2010risk and infected API communities.Dr.P.H., Community Health and Prevention -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6304", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028448000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343082000, "depositedDate": 1551277204000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Chronic HBV Infection and Community\u2010Based Services for High\u2010Risk Asians and Pacific Islanders", "topics": ["Public Health"], "types": [], "year": 201504, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322199.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6304", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322199.pdf"}, {"id": "190325411", "authors": ["Awosan, Christiana Ibilola"], "contributors": ["Hardy, Kenneth V."], "description": "The diminishing rates of marriage and proliferation of individuals who are unmarried in the United States have greatly altered the makeup of heterosexual intimate pair bonding in the general population. For Blacks in the United States, these circumstances are more profound. Over the past decades, the precipitous decline in Black marriages and the salient upsurge of never married Blacks have stimulated much theoretical focus but few empirical research studies on Black adults' heterosexual coupling unions have been undertaken (Camp, 2002; Dixon, 2009; Pinderhughes, 2002; Tucker, 2003). In order to fill the empirical gaps regarding heterosexual coupling unions among Blacks, this qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological study explored the experiences of 26 never married Black men and women (ages 25-35) in their attempts to cultivate and maintain intimate romantic relationships. Through in-depth, open-ended individual interview approach, this phenomenological study, guided with the theoretical frameworks of Africana Womanism (Hudson-Weems, 2008) and Symbolic Interactionism (Charon, 2007), sought to capture and understand how participants described and interpreted their intimate romantic coupling experiences and relationships. The findings illustrated that the overwhelming majority of the participants desired to be married or be involved in a long-term secure and intimate romantic relationship. The majority of the participants felt that the initial stage of cultivating romantic relationships began with strong unspoken connection and passion because of their common Black racial identity, background and culture. Furthermore, participants expressed that their racial location and history in society also contributed to the difficulties that they experienced in maintaining an intimate romantic relationship. Participants contextualized their experiences of cultivating and maintaining intimate romantic relationships within social-historical context of the imposition of whiteness, the residual effects of slavery around skin color and emotional alienation between Black men and women; socio-cultural context of the rarity of long-term, positive quality Black marriages and relationships as well as internalized racial stereotypes; and socio-structural context of gender imbalance in educational, income and career achievements. The findings illustrated that as a result of pairing within these socio-historical, socio-cultural and socio-structural contexts, never married heterosexual Black men and women appeared to be coupling within a shame-based racial context. Participants, therefore, described their experienced coupling processes to be difficult and labor intensive. Given these revealing findings, implications for future research, clinical training and practice, and social policy are provided.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6124", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028502000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Never Married Heterosexual Black Male-Female Intimate Romantic Experiences: A Phenomenological Study", "topics": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Couples Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201405, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190325411.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6124", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190325411.pdf"}, {"id": "190322451", "authors": ["Kabadi, Shaum Mohan"], "contributors": ["Liu, Longjian"], "description": "Diabetes mellitus affects 25.6 million adults and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. Recent evidence indicates that vitamin D may alter glucose metabolism, which suggests it may play a role in reducing risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Although observational studies support pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance as pathways by which vitamin D influences glucose homeostasis, a mechanism involving systemic inflammation remains obscure. We hypothesized that vitamin D was associated with inflammation, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes. In the present investigation, we analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted from 2001-2006 among adults over 20 years of age. We evaluated the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a serum biomarker of vitamin D status, and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. In addition, we assessed the association by subgroups of gender and race/ethnicity and evaluated interaction using joint effects. We determined the association between 25(OH)D and three biomarkers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), and further assessed mediation by CRP on the association between 25(OH)D and hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], a biomarker of glucose homeostasis. Using piecewise regression, it was determined that 25(OH)D was inversely associated with CRP when 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL, but directly associated when 25(OH)D \u2265 20 ng/mL. There was significant interaction by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and abdominal obesity. Furthermore, 25(OH)D was not associated with fibrinogen but inversely associated with homocysteine. Results from path analysis indicate that CRP mediated 14.9% of the association between 25(OH)D and HbA1c in males. We determined that 25(OH)D sufficiency was associated with type 2 diabetes. However, the association was not significant in non-Hispanic Blacks which suggests that 25(OH)D sufficiency as defined by the Institute of Medicine may be inadequate for this subgroup. Our finding that vitamin D may prevent diabetes is consistent with prospective studies which supports a temporal association. Although these findings need to be confirmed in prospective studies and intervention trials, our results may be of large public health value in controlling the current unfavorable diabetes epidemic.Ph.D., Epidemiology -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6727", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028451000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343090000, "depositedDate": 1551352851000}, "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "title": "Association Between Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentration And Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Interaction By Race/Ethnicity And Mediation By Inflammation", "topics": ["Public Health"], "types": [], "year": 201206, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322451.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6727", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322451.pdf"}, {"id": "190322222", "authors": ["Finkelstein, Marlee A."], "contributors": ["Volpe, Stella L."], "description": "Nutrition-related health problems and diseases have become a major concern in recent years.

By examining the various applications of the Nora theme as a mythic motif, we can see how Chinese writers adapted western female heroic patterns to political and social circumstances in China.Heroic theories of the female journey and the reception of Ibsen in China take up the first two chapters. In the next three, this dissertation studies the Nora characters created by three writers, namely, Lu Hsun, Mao Tun, and Ting Ling. Lu Hsun's talk entitled \"What Happens After Nora Leaves Home?\" in 1923 shows his concern about women's economic independence and his pessimism about the fate of liberated Chinese women. In his short story \"Regrets for the Past,\" Lu Hsun presents a Chinese Nora Tzu-chun, who is driven to despair and withers to death. Her silence in the first person male narrative implies the complicated problem of the subjugation of women in both practical life and textual politics. However, Lu Hsun's change toward a more hopeful attitude after the 1930s anticipates the socialist trend of thought in the post-May Fourth era.Among a gallery of female characters which Mao Tun creates, Hsien-hsien in the story \"Creation\" and Mei in the novel Rainbow are typical Nora figures. Both of them leave the family and try to seek self-fulfillment by participating in social movements. However, the pursuit of personal fulfillment will contradict their socialist commitment. Thus their heroic pursuits are destined to fail. Also Mao Tun's presentation of Mei as a sex object at various points undermines the feminist cause which he seemingly advocates. In all, Mao Tun's socialist stance about women's emancipation will prove ineffective and illusory.In her early story \"Miss Sophie's Diary,\" Ting Ling presents a woman's struggles with love and sexuality. Sophie, her female hero, does not experience the economic worries and difficulties in leaving home. Nevertheless, she challenges several patriarchal assumptions and achieves sufficient illumination to presence her sense of self. Also Ting Ling's choice of the diary form shows Sophie's creative ability and helps to convey the idea of \"ecriture feminine\" by writing about a woman's repressed emotion in a language closer to the body. The emphasis on the intimate friendship between Sophie and her older female friend Yun suggests how significant the addition of the \"other woman\" is to the development of a female self. The hidden theme of female bonding and even female homoeroticism proves that Sophie has entered the third stage of a female hero's journey, that is: she identifies with the mother figure and affirms her gendered identity.The comparison of these three writers with Ibsen and among themselves shows that the reception of Ibsen in China is strongly affected by the special historical and social contexts of the May Fourth Movement and after. The Nora characters in these literary works demonstrate different approaches to the woman question in twentieth-century China.

They brought to life their various interpretations of eugenics in many embodiments, from programs for physical education and better nutrition, to movements to segregate and even eliminate Jews and other \"dysgenic\" populations, such as criminals and prostitutes. Proponents of eugenics used their significant roles in public life to popularize theories of hereditary determinism in the realms of intellectual discourse and social reform. They offered a path towards modernization which would conserve vital elements of the past while embracing the future. Their synthesis of tradition and modernization helped negotiate the apparently irreconcilable debates during the interwar period between traditionalist conservatives and their opponents--the Europeanizing modernists.Regardless of their various political alliances, which sometimes were prompted by sheer pragmatism rather than strong ideological convictions, eugenicists played an important, if unrecognized role in delegitimizing liberal parliamentary ideas, especially among the educated public and students in higher education institutions. Eugenicists used the language of science and objectivity to delegitimize the principles of liberty and democracy, by portraying these concepts as anti-rational, for they presumably ran against the universal law of heredity, differentiation and evolution. According to eugenicists, to claim individual autonomy over one's actions meant acting irresponsibly, for it showed complete disregard for the hereditary factors that conditioned each individual's development and behavior. Furthermore, democracy seemed a dangerous practice, for it allowed the mediocre to impose their will over the superior, and thus ran counter the principle of evolution through controlled selection. Instead, eugenicists depicted progress as a function of responsible action by a leadership selected from the hereditary elites. This phenomenon helps explain the attraction of many among the young generation during the early 1930s towards anti-liberal politics.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23842", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384580000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008626000, "depositedDate": 1304982000000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Disciplining the future.

Molded in the rhetorical tactics of Southern-demagogue Ben Tillman of South Carolina, this peculiar art form of mass politics persisted without regard to region or party, a concept developed in studies of Democrat Curley (Massachusetts) and Republicans McCarthy and Goldwater (Wisconsin and Arizona), thus encompassing the South, Northeast, Midwest, and West. Each subject, of course, practiced demagoguery on an individual basis. By the middle and late 1970s, however, the once-Old Right of the Republican Party---inspired by Goldwater's 1964 rhetoric on national \"morality\" and racial scapegoats; and inspired as well, though to a lesser extent, by McCarthy's rhetoric---metamorphosed as the \"New Right.\" Through its politicians, think tanks, and well-financed political action committees, the movement spoke as a unified and collective voice, using precisely the same demagogic rhetorical techniques once exploited only by individual politicians. In short, during the twentieth century the practice of demagoguery moved from a personal to party-wide basis.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/84636", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1528754474000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009079000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Political Low Roads: The Rhetoric of Twentieth-Century American Demagoguery and the Rise of the New Right", "topics": ["Political Science, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/84636", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291776290", "authors": ["Conlin, Michael Francis"], "contributors": ["Johannsen, Robert W."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "297 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1999.This study traces the development of the Smithsonian Institution from its beginning in 1846 to the end of the Civil War in 1865. As the leading antebellum patron of the natural, physical, and social sciences in the United States, the Smithsonian exerted great force on the shape of the American scientific community. The Institution, in turn, was shaped by political concerns, demands for practical applications of science, conformity with natural theology, nationalism, and disputes between scientists. Joseph Henry, the leading American physical scientist of his generation, established an equilibrium between these competing forces and established a research program which supported and published original American research. Congress forced him to accept a large building, a museum, a library, and an art gallery. Although Henry managed to shed the library and the art gallery, the building and museum remained. The partisan politics of the 1850s and the Civil War exacerbated his difficulties.

After an introductory chapter that maps out the current historiography on late nineteenth and early twentieth religious belief and practice, as well as on the British women's suffrage movement, Chapter Two analyzes the representations of religion in the personal narratives (both published and unpublished) of a selection of Protestant, Catholic and Jewish suffrage campaigners who represented a variety of class backgrounds. Chapter Three examines suffragist and suffragettes' appropriation of Christian imagery, Protestant terminology, and evangelical styles to frame their demands for the vote. Chapters Four and Five explore the denominational and theological frameworks shaping suffragist and suffragette political action through a close study of five religious suffrage leagues. These leagues were unique to Britain and represented the Anglican, Catholic, Free Church, Quaker and Jewish faiths.

Chapter One provides a general description of research questions and approaches for the study. Chapter Two examines existing studies of 'neoliberalism' to construct an analytical framework of the South Korean case. This study adopts the analytical perspective to see neoliberalism as 'global financial hegemony' in the postwar period, and it focuses on the relationship and dynamics between neoliberalism as such and the transformation of a 'national economic and financial system'. In Chapter Three, theories of the 'developmental state' and the shaping and transition of the South Korean developmental state between the 1960s and the mid-1990s are discussed. Above all, this study focuses on the financial sector in the historically changing institutional configuration of the developmental state in the country. Chapter Four examines recent historical events such as the 1997 financial crisis in South Korea and swift neoliberal transformations in its political economy following the crisis. This chapter is mainly about 'politics of neoliberal reforms', and it analyzes the socio-political conditions and outcomes of swift neoliberalization in Korea during the post-1997 period. Chapter Five examines post-1997 neoliberal transformations in Korean financial sectors including banks, NBFIs, and securities markets. This chapter focuses on the situation and role of transnational economic actors in the neoliberal transformation of the domestic economy during the post-1997 period. Here, transnational institutional investors in the Korean economic and financial sectors are analyzed. This chapter deals with the questions of establishing 'global financial hegemony' in the process of the intensive neoliberal transformations of a national economic system that had been formerly considered a 'non-liberal and production-oriented' political economy, such as the Korean developmental state. The final chapter summarizes discussions in this study and suggests its implications for further studies.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/86219", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089445000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512026000, "depositedDate": 1458214530000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "The Neoliberal Transformation of the Developmental State in South Korea: The Financial Sector, Reform Politics, and Global Capital", "topics": ["Sociology, Social Structure and Development"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/86219", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291778151", "authors": ["Gasaway, John Gerald"], "contributors": ["Kim Rotzoll"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "352 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1999.A comprehensive reading of national newspapers from 1840 reveals a surprising conclusion: Whigs did not say that Harrison lived in a log cabin and in fact went into great detail describing his actual house.

Belden"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "What would a materialist position today be like, especially after Marx and Foucault? In order to address this question, the dissertation examines the relationship between Marx and Foucault by situating them within a new and specific kind of materialist discursive practice which Foucault seeks to develop on the basis of the discourse initiated by Marx at the modern theoretical conjuncture. For this purpose, it tries to bring to new light Foucault's understanding of Marx (the apparent absence of Marx in Foucault's work which is frequently taken by Foucauldian commentators as indicating his break with Marx) within the context of their commonly shared materialist challenge to the tradition of the history of philosophy.The dissertation begins by arguing that Marx's and Foucault's materialist positions cannot be understood in terms of the traditional opposition between idealism and materialism concerning the question of philosophical foundations of knowledge, i.e., as a doctrine opposed to idealism. Rather, they are intended to overcome the modern anthropological mode of thought, which underpins such a dualistic category, in terms of \"labor\" and \"body,\" respectively, which primarily play a central epistemological role in the decentering of the subject by suppressing purely philosophical questions about human nature and history. The major significances of their materialist discourses, it is further argued, lie in that Marx and Foucault perceive modern social practices in terms of power (rather than original significations or intersubjective meanings), i.e., as a structural or strategic configuration of power relations operating beyond human will and consciousness and that in doing so, they further seek to disrupt the modern idealist/humanist political notions and displace the location of politics beyond the state and its apparatuses. In light of these materialist conceptions of politics, both Marx's and Foucault's positions on the questions of subjectivity and struggle or resistance are further examined focusing on the productive and relational/strategic notions of power which can be found in their mature works.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19341", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586088849000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511749000, "depositedDate": 1309968549000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Foucault, Marx and the question of politics: The materialist problematics of power", "topics": ["Philosophy", "Political Science, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19341", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291760240", "authors": ["Kristjansson, Svanur"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "324 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1977.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/66673", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089278000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511948000, "depositedDate": 1458212335000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Conflict and Consensus in Icelandic Politics, 1916-44", "topics": ["Political Science, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/66673", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291761443", "authors": ["Mcnamee, Stephen John"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "280 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1980.A central issue in the study of politics is the role of the state in the accumulation of private capital. Although there have been numerous theoretical discussions of this issue, few empirical analyses have been carried out. This thesis examines the historical impact of the Du Pont-State relationship on the capital accumulation of the Du Pont Company.The history of the Du Pont Company is divided into five stages of capital accumulation: organizational formation, monopolization, diversification, research and development, and foreign expansion. The stages of capital accumulation are conceptualized as organizational paradigms. Each paradigm constitutes a guide for organizational activity in pursuit of three interrelated objectives--profit, growth, and stability.This thesis documents the construction of external environments on the part of the Du Pont Company through the five stages of capital accumulation. This construction is viewed as a rationalizing strategy to reduce environmental uncertainty. Two main types of environmental uncertainty are identified. Material uncertainty pertains to uncertainty regarding the flow of resources through the organization. Symbolic uncertainty pertains to uncertainties of meaning attached to organizational activities. Material construction of environmental conditions provided the Du Pont Company with a means of capital accumulation, while symbolic construction of environmental conditions provided the Du Pont Company with a means of capital legitimation.This thesis therefore details the processes by which the state participated in this material and symbolic construction of environmental conditions. Major changes in the Du Pont-State relationship were brought about by contradictions in the capital accumulation process. These contradictions interfered with the prevailing mode of capital accumulation which, in turn, led to organizational crisis and uncertainty. These uncertainties were resolved in part through the renegotiation of the Du Pont-State relationship.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/67902", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089288000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511953000, "depositedDate": 1458214365000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Du Pont-State Linkages: A Socio-Historical Analysis", "topics": ["Sociology, Industrial and Labor Relations"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/67902", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291742015", "authors": ["Brown, Linsey N."], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "Thesis (B.A.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1995.Includes bibliographical reference.U of I OnlyTheses restricted to UIUC community onl", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/47732", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089100000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511870000, "depositedDate": 1458338693000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "The domestic politics of foreign policy", "topics": ["Theses -- UIUC"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/47732", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291749781", "authors": ["Stoeckel, Althea Lucille"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "176 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1958.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/56138", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089180000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511903000, "depositedDate": 1458209503000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Politics and Administration in the American Colonial Colleges", "topics": ["History, Modern"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/56138", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291751129", "authors": ["Barker, Lucius Jefferson"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "258 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1954.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/57486", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089194000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511909000, "depositedDate": 1458212004000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Offshore Oil Politics: A Study in Public Policy Making", "topics": ["Political Science, General", "Energy"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/57486", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291718638", "authors": ["Burnier, DeLysa"], "contributors": ["Wirt, Frederick M."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "This dissertation rests on the premise that public policy possesses a symbolic dimension. Although such a dimension has been long acknowledged, little formal attention has been paid to it beyond noting the presence of symbols in policy language and actions. This dissertation has argued for an expanded conception of symbolic politics that encompasses both the use of intangible resources and the politics of meaning. The politics of meaning centers on how a particular meaning or interpretation for a policy, event, issue, or action is established. Furthermore, it raises questions about how policy problems are defined, whose definitions prevail, and what kinds of symbols and language are used in policy actors' definitions of the policy situation.To explore the politics of meaning, this dissertation developed a symbolic interactionist policy perspective and applied it to Ohio's enterprise zone program. State and local officials involved in the program were interviewed, and from their interview statements program accounts were derived. These program accounts centered on officials' understandings of the zone program, its goals, tax abatement, and definitions of program success. From these accounts, the enterprise zone program's symbolic dimension, or its range of meanings as defined by policy actors, was established. Overall, the range of policy meaning for the zone program is fairly narrow. Ideological \"free market\" language has been replaced by pragmatic means-end language.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/22861", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586088883000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511764000, "depositedDate": 1421272420000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "The politics of meaning in the entrepreneurial city", "topics": ["Political Science, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/22861", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291757130", "authors": ["Mcgriggs, Lee Augustus"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "281 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1975.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/63540", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089249000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511935000, "depositedDate": 1458212284000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Black Legislative Politics in Illinois: A Theoretical and Structural Analysis", "topics": ["Political Science, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/63540", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291777062", "authors": ["Guala, Federico Alejandro"], "contributors": ["Hadi Salehi Esfahani"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "86 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2002.This study focuses on two broad topics related to private and public finance in Argentina during the 1990s.

In chapter 1, cost \"X\"-inefficiency of financial institutions is estimated via the Distribution-Free Approach, introduced by Berger (1993), and then banks with different characteristics (private vs. public and domestic vs. foreign) are evaluated based on their cost distribution by using quantile regression analysis. In chapter 2, three well-known measures of scale and scope efficiency are estimated; namely, the Ray Scale Economy Measure (Baumol, Panzar, and Willig, 1982), the Expansion Path Scale Economy Measure (Berger, Hanweck and Humphrey, 1987), and the Expansion Path Subadditivity Measure (Berger et al., 1987). On the public finance side, chapter 3 offers a novel methodology to account for how politics and institutional weaknesses of provincial jurisdictions in Argentina (in addition to economic variables) have played important roles by allowing these provinces to raise the aggregate risks for the country by excessive borrowing and spending.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/85525", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089438000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512022000, "depositedDate": 1458206724000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Three Essays on Private and Public Finance in Argentina", "topics": ["Economics, Finance"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/85525", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291771562", "authors": ["Cortez, Gabriel A."], "contributors": ["Anderson, James D."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "177 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.This research is an historical analysis of a social movement that took place in Chicago's Little Village community.

The movement reached a climax when a group of residents held a hunger strike to bring attention to CPS' negligence on the issue. The methods used for gathering data is a combination of a group interview with five hunger strikers, archival research, periodicals, internal document analysis, journal entries, internet sources, and peer feedback. The researcher searched for common themes that connect the varied sources and provided an interpretation on how key individuals, events, and decisions influenced the movement.

In the mid-1960s, the electorate became, and has remained, polarized around the race issue. Scholars have also discovered that race provides a core structuring principle for a substantial portion of the public. In explaining this apparent centrality of race, they hypothesize that it has become an integral component of citizens' political belief systems and, thus, imply that it inevitably enters into political reasoning. Although compelling, this explanation for race's prevalence, the \"centrality\" hypothesis, largely overlooks the causal forces in the external political environment that foster, and thereby induce, racially based thinking. The central thesis of this research, the \"racialization\" thesis, provides an alternative explanation for the predominance of race in American politics. As race is extraordinarily divisive, and has proven its electoral might, many candidates have alluring incentives to exploit this issue for political gain. Through the skillful use of manipulative political language and other subtle--and sometimes not-so-subtle--means, they are able effectively to elicit racially driven mass political reasoning. A major implication here is that race need not pervade mass political thinking. The political psychology associated with racializing politics (categorization strategies, priming and attitude accessibility, stereotyping, affective and emotional reactions to political stimuli, and the automatic processing of information) is discussed in depth. An experimental methodology is employed to test the validity of both theses. As the findings are somewhat mixed, support is obtained for both theses.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/82595", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089414000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512009000, "depositedDate": 1458212505000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "The Predominance of Race in American Mass Political Thinking: Racial Belief System Centrality and the Racialization of American Politics", "topics": ["American Studies"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/82595", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291774095", "authors": ["Breezeel, Gary Steven"], "contributors": ["Michael Krassa"], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "327 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2003.Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the construction of publicly financed sport facilities. The costs associated with these projects frequently necessitate voter approval through the referendum process. This project represents an examination of the politics surrounding stadium referenda. It was undertaken in an attempt to identify the influences affecting levels of public support for these stadium referenda. A theoretical model of voter support for public financing proposals was proposed and tested. That model suggests that support for stadium referenda is driven by voter perceptions in three areas of consideration: (1) economic concerns related to the cost and expected impact of the proposed facility as well as the economic context in which the referendum is placed before the voters; (2) emotional consequences associated with the outcome of the referendum; (3) the perceived level of mobilization among opponents of the project. The model was tested using a case study approach within the context of three referenda involving attempts by Major League Baseball franchises in Arlington, Texas; Seattle, Washington; and St. Paul, Minnesota to obtain public financing for the construction of new facilities. Examination of each of the cases yielded results consistent with the predictions generated by the application of the model, indicating that voter support for public financing proposals is driven by perceptions of economic and emotional consequences and by levels of mobilization among project opponents.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/82558", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089414000, "metadataUpdated": 1594512009000, "depositedDate": 1458212441000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "If You Build It, They Will Stay: Evaluating Citizen Support for Public Financing of Sport Facilities", "topics": ["Political Science, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/82558", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291774104", "authors": ["Armeanu, Oana I."], "contributors": ["Leff, Carol S."], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "223 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.I test my argument concerning the role of political parties and coalitional politics using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods.

Thus, this study is not a mere addition to the existing case studies on the women's movement in the Middle East. It is rather an innovative approach that challenges the static view, based on the opposition between feminism and Islamism, with a more dynamic view that looks at interdependencies, relationships and exchanges between these movements.

Undoubtedly, many of those in positions of power worried that common people might \"take for truth the test of ridicule\" prominent in these prints, an event that would be fatal to the existing political structure of the country. The contemporary caricatures which satirically and sometimes savagely attacked the government, however, indicate that a variety of beliefs and traditional concepts helped to form public perceptions about the causes and implications of large-scale domestic disturbances and the government responses to those events.Contemporary caricatures indicate that the public seemed unwilling to believe either the government's assertions that the country teetered on the brink of revolution or the claims of some reformers that only radical political reform could save the country from a tyrannical government. The course of contemporary events played a major part in the formation of the public's perceptions, but the symbolism and content of contemporary political caricatures indicates that public perceptions about events, such as the ongoing political unrest, were often colored by traditional beliefs and ideals, such as the strong belief in the right of all Englishmen to claim the protection of the British constitution in matters of freedom of speech and petition. Other attitudes, such as xenophobia and a sense of moral justice (revealed by acts of charivari or \"rough music\"), played a more subtle role in influencing the impressions the public formed about the political situation of post-war England. Caricatures clearly reveal the importance of the connection between these attitudes and beliefs and politics during the post-war agitation in Britain.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23773", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586088892000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511768000, "depositedDate": 1305268891000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "\"To take for truth the test of ridicule\": Public perceptions, political controversy, and English political caricature, 1815-1821", "topics": ["History, European", "Political Science, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23773", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "291764526", "authors": ["Kagawa, Lily Siu"], "contributors": [], "datePublished": "10000-01-01", "description": "349 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1983.Legal moralisms, such as gambling prohibitions, have long been established in American law. This dissertation explored in general, the rational and utility of gambling prohibitions, as well as their application in an ethnic community. In an overview of gambling in the United States, the development of and politics underlying gambling laws and the claims and documentation of harms from gambling were examined. Some positive functions of gambling, such as to provide recreation, the achievement of status and social integration, were delineated. A review of the costs, effect, and feasibilities of gambling enforcement was undertaken and concluded that public tolerance, the pervasiveness of the games, and the perception of harmlessness have undermined the implementation of the law. Furthermore, threats to legal protections, the creation of adverse public attitudes toward the law, and the provision of lucrative profits for syndicates, with which they use for public corruption, culminate to suggest that the costs of gambling laws are not commensurate with the good effects derived. Alternatives to the use of the criminal law to control gambling were recommended.These ideas were applied in an examination of gambling and the effects of gambling laws upon the Chinese in the United States in first, a historical instance among Chinese immigrants in the last century, and second, a field study of current effects. In the historical survey, the research outlined the gambling activities, and their nature and functions. An association between gambling and criminal organization was developed, and the use of gambling enforcement to discredit and harass the immigrants, as part of the anti-Chinese agitation in the west, was shown.Currently, gambling in an American Chinatown was studied through participant observations of social games in the home and at a social club, and interviews of community members as well as enforcement and judicial personnel, in order to discover the nature, scope, and meaning of gambling for participants. Functions similar to those in the larger society were found, and similar problems in enforcement arose as well. However, the enforcement situation was aggravated by a communications and cultural gap between the police and the community, inadequate personnel, resources and techniques to deal with crime in a minority neighborhood, and public anxieties about the police. Gambling enforcement highlighted the police intrusions and was a focus of popular resentment. While gambling was not found to create any substantial harm among players and produced some benefits, the significant ill effects from enforcement showed the disutility of criminalizing relatively harmless immoralities in a plural society.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/70997", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "7595", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "IDEALS @ Illinois", "uri": null, "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1586089317000, "metadataUpdated": 1594511966000, "depositedDate": 1458214395000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Gambling and the Law: A Study of the Utility of Gambling and Its Prohibition in an American Chinatown", "topics": ["Sociology, Criminology and Penology"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/70997", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "29163217", "authors": ["Madison, Kenneth Glenn"], "contributors": [], "description": "256 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1968.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/60957", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1432658196000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008901000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "The Wydevilles, 1086-1491: The Background and Rise of a Family in Medieval English Politics", "topics": ["History, Medieval"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/60957", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "29174565", "authors": ["Liu, Tzu-Kai"], "contributors": ["Keller, Janet D."], "description": "272 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2009.My dissertation, &quot;Living with Hierarchies,&quot; is an ethnographic study of transformative meanings of ethno-religious practices, multiple language use, and identity politics among Southwest China's rural Wa Buddhist people. These villagers are socially and historically positioned between the dominant Chinese state and transborder Buddhist power. After analyzing their ritual chants, talk, and individual narratives, I argue that the construction of Wa Buddhist identities entails alternative strategic positionings within multiple, encompassed, and nested hierarchies. Wa Buddhist cultural and religious revival represents a key feature of Chinese ethnic politics in which the cultural is closely inter-connected with the political. In contrast to the extant literature on ethnic politics and Chinese ethnic minorities, in this dissertation I further argues that the specifics of four ethnolinguistic and religious contexts (including the history of religious conversion, ritual chants, oratory, and individual narratives about interethnic boundaries, hierarchy, and aspiration) constitute a meaningful and agentive resource for recalling social inequality, momentarily highlighting social difference, and construing identity. Specifically, this dissertation offers ethnographic data drawn from examining the sites and contexts in which conventional ethno-religious repertoires and language use are critically subject to negotiation and reapplication in postsocialist Wa Buddhist communities in China.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72385", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1432659696000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008981000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Living With Hierarchies: Religion, Language, and Personhood Among Wa Buddhists in Postsocialist China", "topics": ["Religion, General", "Anthropology, Cultural"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/72385", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "4828500", "authors": ["Jeong, Kyeong-Soo"], "contributors": ["Bullock, David S."], "description": "Agricultural trade protection has been common in most industrialized nations for the last decades. While economic inefficiency of trade protection policy has been argued, the assertion may not hold if institutions functioning in economic equilibrium are appropriately recognized. Becker proposes that currently adopted policy tends to be more efficient than others (efficient redistribution hypothesis; ERH). Although the ERH has been a crucial assumption in many political economy models, an empirical test employing a rigorous method has not yet appeared. While the political preference function (PPF) studies have been abundant, they entail serious methodological weaknesses and their political weight estimates are often misleading.To coherently conduct the ERH test and PPF analysis, this study modeled a integrated structure of complex Japanese beef markets. Most parameter estimates were significant, and specification and model validation tests generally suggest the good model performance. Based on consistent parameter estimates, effects of Japanese beef market tariffication and complete liberalization on interest group welfare were measured. While the results generally agree with other studies, this study alone provides statistical inference of welfare measures and sufficient evidence that marketing groups and pork producers are also major interest groups related to beef politics.Using Bullock's rigorous test method, this study tested the ERH for Japanese beef policies. The results indicate that the ERH in 1990 is rejected, but that in 1991 cannot be rejected. Results of the ERH test for 1990 may imply the possible existence of other Pareto optimal policy.A least square PPF method is developed to relax the restrictive assumptions in the previous PPF studies. Using the nonparametric bootstrap method, standard errors and bootstrap confidence intervals of PPF weights were estimated. Large magnitudes and mixed signs of PPF weights along with large standard errors and confidence intervals strongly indicate that the PPF weights are seriously biased and not informative. Overall, the implications of these results are grave for past PPF studies which assumed that the number of policy instruments exactly equaled the number of interest groups minus one, and simply used \"point estimate\" PPF weights to draw inferences about the revealed political powers of interest groups.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/20077", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384574000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008601000, "depositedDate": 1319497200000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "The welfare economics and the political economy of Japanese beef trade liberalization: An empirical application of new political economy theory", "topics": ["Economics, Agricultural"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/20077", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "4831451", "authors": ["Schick, Susanne Martha"], "contributors": ["Johannsen, Robert W."], "description": "German immigrants residing in the Old Northwest during the Civil War enjoyed a rich and unique political culture. As Democrats and as foreign-born citizens, German midwesterners remained actively involved in party politics throughout the Civil War. German Democrats focused on the draft, civil liberties' violations, taxation, the increase in federal power, evolving war aims, and emancipation. In addition, Germans continued to voice concern with perceived threats to their ethnic identity. The German-language press wrote often about temperance agitation, Sabbatarianism, and other attempts at social control. Involvement in the political process meant not only voting and attendance at party gatherings, but also serving as elected officials in numerous municipal, county, and state level posts. Leaders emerged from within the ethnic group and included newspaper editors, clergymen, and members of the business community. A careful study of the German-language political newspapers of the region reveals fascinating information about the attitudes, ideology, and behavior of these foreign-born Democratic constituents. The defeat of General George B. McClellan in his quest for the presidency in 1864 was bitterly disappointing for the German Democrats, yet they were not demoralized. There was always another campaign for which to prepare; anticipation for final victory kept disgruntled immigrants from losing faith in the democratic system. It was this optimism for the future that would sustain and inspire German Democrats as they continued to explore their unique place in America's political world.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23028", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384579000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008621000, "depositedDate": 1365721200000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "\"For God, Mac, and country\": The political worlds of midwestern Germans during the Civil War era", "topics": ["History, United States"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/23028", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158299681", "authors": ["Barnett, Zolo George"], "contributors": [], "description": "371 p.Thesis (Educat.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1956.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/76120", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1528754389000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009001000, "depositedDate": 1458086400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Education and the Politics of Elijah Jordan", "topics": ["Education, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/76120", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158304457", "authors": ["Johnson, Sherita"], "contributors": ["Foote, Stephanie"], "description": "175 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.Although the South has been an enduring site of criticism in American Studies and in American literary history, my dissertation argues that it is impossible to consider what the \"South\" and what \"southernness\" mean as cultural references without looking at how black women have contributed to and contested any unified definition of that region. I focus on the late nineteenth century, a period of intense regional conflict when southern blacks witnessed the reassertion of white hegemony. Hence, the idea of the South and southern identity become synonymous with \"whiteness\" as it solidifies in literary and political narratives. The scope of my dissertation examines the relationship between Southern literature and the South's social history. Specifically, I look at that relationship by focusing on black women, fictional and historical, arguing that they are unacknowledged agents of cultural change. Though black women were integral to southern society, they are often invisible in historical accounts of regional politics and culture, especially as southern black women. Black women, likewise, are a largely under-critiqued presence in the regional fiction of the period.

The fifty years of colonial rule following the imposition of Italian rule in 1890 failed to forge a common identity among the various communities in Eritrea. Lacking a common bond which could transcend sectarian views and confessional interests, the political forces which emerged in Eritrea in the 1940s, were unable to agree among themselves on the territory's future.The leadership of Eritrea's various communities found it easier to rally support along parochial lines rather than through an all encompassing Eritreanism which did not command the loyalty of a significant section of the population. Pre-colonial identity played crucial role in determining political affiliation. The majority of the Christian population supported the Unionist Party which stood for integration with Ethiopia, while the Moslem community remained apprehensive about the prospect of union with the Christian empire.This study underscores that the notion of constructing an Eritrean nation appealed to few in the territory in the 1940s and 1950s and was firmly resisted by a great majority of the highland peasantry and the urban population. The initiative to create an all-inclusive Eritrean identity came largely from interested foreign patrons. This paper amply documents the role played by the respective powers in fostering Eritrean separatism.This work highlights crucial developments in Eritrean politics such as the demise of the Ethio-Eritrean federation, the birth and development of the armed secessionist movement, the course of the bitter civil war between rival guerrilla factions, and the process through which the EPLF attempted to impose national consensus through force of arms. It argues that contrary to widely spread assumptions, secessionism was not desired by the majority of Eritreans when the insurgency started in the early 1960s. This paper concludes that the survival and strengthening of the Eritrean insurgency owes a great deal to the political failure of the Ethiopian state.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19718", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384574000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008597000, "depositedDate": 1317164400000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Discord and fragmentation in Eritrean politics, 1941-1981", "topics": ["History, African", "History, Modern", "Political Science, General"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19718", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "4828053", "authors": ["Dulebohn, James Hamilton"], "contributors": ["Ferris, Gerald R."], "description": "Organizational justice research has found that fairness considerations are ubiquitous in organizational life and that if employees are provided with an opportunity to provide input or voice into procedures that lead to outcomes that affect them, their perceptions of fairness are enhanced. Research in organizational politics has found that employees often attempt to gain input through the use of dyadic social influence behavior or influence tactics. While organizational justice and organizational politics have separately informed human resource management, there have been few efforts to integrate the two areas. Previous efforts were inadequate because of their failure to integrate the major findings of the psychology of justice with organizational politics.The objective of this dissertation was to integrate organizational justice and organizational politics. The integration of these two areas was accomplished theoretically and empirically. A framework was presented that conceptualized the role of social influence on the fairness evaluation process. Following, a field study was used to test several of the relationships portrayed in the framework. Specifically, an examination was made of the effects of the use of influence tactics on employee perceptions of the fairness of the performance evaluation process.Primary questions addressed in the dissertation included: (1) What is the effect on employees' fairness perceptions from their use of upward influence tactics? (2) Do upward influence tactics represent an informal mechanism of voice that enhance the fairness perceptions of the performance evaluation process in a similar way as formal mechanisms of voice? The results of the study indicated that the use of influence tactics represented a mechanism of voice. Upward influence tactics were found to have similar fairness enhancing effects on perceptions of fairness that formal voice mechanisms have been found to have. The results of the study provide researchers with a integrative framework for examining organizational justice and politics and suggest the appropriateness of extending the concept of voice to include alternative means of voice such as influence tactics.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19630", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384574000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008596000, "depositedDate": 1316041200000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Social influence and organizational justice in employee reactions to performance appraisals", "topics": ["Psychology, Social", "Business Administration, Management", "Psychology, Industrial"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/19630", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "4829712", "authors": ["Erni, John Nguyet"], "contributors": ["Grossberg, Lawrence"], "description": "This study examines how AIDS treatment issues (e.g. the politics of biomedical research, social representations of the \"AIDS body,\" the alternative treatment movement, AIDS treatment activism) are represented in the media, and argues that the overall discourse of \"curing AIDS\" is organized around the totalizing and contradictory narratives of AIDS' curability/incurability, and that this binaristic mode of thinking has important historical--in fact, \"conjunctural\"--effects upon mainstream medicine's historical position of authority.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/21289", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1340384576000, "metadataUpdated": 1608008609000, "depositedDate": 1333321200000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "Unstable frontiers: Medicine, the media, and the cultural politics of \"curing\" AIDS", "topics": ["Speech Communication", "Health Sciences, Public Health", "Mass Communications"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/21289", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "158300855", "authors": ["Wuliger, Gregory Tod"], "contributors": [], "description": "744 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1987.The Fairness Doctrine is a policy of the Federal Communications Commission requiring broadcast licensees to seek out and cover controversial issues of public importance and to present such coverage fairly. In practice, this has meant that broadcast licensees have had to grant response time for opposing points of view whenever they have raised controversial issues of public importance. Supporters of the doctrine say that it provides at least some diversity of ideas in a profit-oriented broadcast system; critics say that it inhibits broadcasters from covering controversial issues and violates their first amendment rights.This dissertation regards the Fairness Doctrine as a symbol closely related to such broad general myths as &quot;freedom of expression,&quot; &quot;free enterprise,&quot; and &quot;the marketplace of ideas.&quot; Relying on Congressional hearings, court cases, and FCC rulings, the dissertation argues that elements of these myths are embodied in the American system of broadcasting, of which the Fairness Doctrine is just a part. It studies the system from a historical standpoint, showing the origins of these myths and symbols, and arguing that these myths and symbols have no objective reality, but are simply social constructions generated within the parameters of politics, economics, technology, and culture. Broadcast regulation in the 20th century is compared with the licensing of printing in Tudor and Stuart England to show that regulation generally creates monopoly. To legitimize such monopoly in terms of generally accepted myths, such symbols as &quot;fairness&quot; are necessary. The commitment to these symbols by the broadcasters who live with them is shown historically to be subservient to the profit motive. Further, it is shown that government benefits by seeming to sanction &quot;fairness&quot; while in fact limiting the expression of unpopular ideas over a medium it fears; industry benefits by obtaining markets through advertising; and the public benefits by participating in a consumer economy. What suffers dramatically is the level of public debate. The dissertation concludes that the Fairness Doctrine is largely ineffective in promoting meaningful public discussion, but that there is little reason to abolish it unless the broadcast system that produced it is also abandoned.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "identifiers": ["oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/77294", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "198", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1528754400000, "metadataUpdated": 1608009012000, "depositedDate": 1458172800000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "The Fairness Doctrine in Its Historical Context: A Symbolic Approach", "topics": ["Mass Communications"], "types": [], "year": 10000, "oai": "oai:www.ideals.illinois.edu:2142/77294", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "190327009", "authors": ["Nino, Alba"], "contributors": ["Davey, Maureen"], "description": "Immigration continues to be an important source of demographic growth in the United States (US Census Bureau, 2012). Mental health disciplines in general, and couple and family therapy in particular are paying more attention to immigration as an experience that can profoundly affect the identity and relationships of individuals and families. However, the impact of immigration has been addressed predominantly for immigrant clients. In the extant literature, much less attention has been paid to immigrants as couple and family therapists regarding how their experiences of immigration can affect clinical encounters with clients in the US. In order to fill this gap, this phenomenological dissertation study was designed to examine the clinical experiences of couple and family therapists who were born and raised outside of the US and who are clinically active in this country. Symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969; Mead, 1934) and the multicultural perspective as defined by Hardy and Laszloffy (2002) guided the development of this qualitative study which followed the stages and tasks of transcendental phenomenology (Moustakas, 1994). Thirteen immigrant couple and family therapists who were clinically active in the US volunteered for in-depth interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the transcriptions were analyzed with the assistance of MaxQDA and using conventional content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) to identify frequent and notable themes. The following major themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) the experience of immigration, (b) immigrant therapists and their clients, (c) development as a clinician, (d) relationships with colleagues and other professionals, and (e) a name for ourselves. The five major themes suggest that the exposure to different cultures during therapeutic encounters in the US and working in the midst of cultural differences affected participants\u2019 clinical work. First, findings supported previous literature that described immigrant therapists as capable of having an outsider perspective, being more aware of their assumptions, being more flexible in their definitions, and experiencing discrimination by clients and other professionals in the US. Second, findings suggest that the therapeutic encounter is a relationship where meanings between therapists and clients are exchanged which facilitates identity transformations, the debunking of stereotypes, and the negotiation of new meanings. Regarding implications, findings from this study suggest that feedback from clients, supervisors, colleagues and faculty members affect the formation of immigrant CFTs\u2019 evolving professional identities. Supervisors and faculty members in training programs should develop a more balanced view of immigrant CFT students and professionals that more closely attends to their needs and nurtures their strengths. CFT training programs and clinical supervisors should teach diversity and multiculturalism in a way that recognizes human diversity without promoting rigid categorization and divisiveness. Future research should pay closer attention to the strategies that immigrant CFTs develop that helps them clinically work in the midst of cultural differences with clients in the US.Ph.D., Couple and

women\u2019s Press, as well as women as subjectivities, engaged themselves in processes of interpretation, deliberation, confrontation, and internalization of western ideals, models and patterns of life. This receptive process is examined either at the level of women\u2019s writing and discursive imprint or at the level of other modes of material/physical or symbolic enunciation of the female Subject. \nWithin the theoretical/methodological framework of the Politics of Location (aka Standpoint Theory) and Situated Knowledges and in the light of feminist poststructuralism, processes of convergence between female and patriarchal discourses and women\u2019s complicity to patriarchy are discussed. In the postcolonial context that emerges from the amalgamation of western and local discourses, I also illustrate the internal conflicts that define women\u2019s discourse and women\u2019s subjectivity and discuss women\u2019s skillful attempts to manipulate western cultural codes or influence western narratives and ideals. Most importantly, I present instances of patriarchal narratives being proficiently employed to become the springboard for the articulation of a discourse that causes ruptures in the private-public bipolar pattern and ultimately reframes women\u2019s social roles and agency in the face of patriarchal norms. \nIn this context, some other more alternative and less conspicuous loci of female agency and self-definition are brought to light. These loci come to question the narrowly rational and dichotomous interpretations of Space and Knowledge. They open up new perspectives towards the construction of a sense of Self that gradually disentangles itself from heteronomy. They bring women\u2019s agency out of historical obscurity and ultimately open up emancipatory pathways in the course of their shifting from the \u2018margins\u2019 towards the center of civil society", "identifiers": ["oai:Elocus.tkl:dlib/2/3/8/metadata-dlib-1551269780-55355-27418.tkl", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "3258", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "University of Crete", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1562689200000, "metadataUpdated": 1611323718000, "depositedDate": 1551277274000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "The reception of western ideals and models in the ottoman territories folusing on women's press and female subjectivity: (1870-early 20th century)", "topics": ["\u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03bb\u03b7\u03c8\u03b7", "\u0394\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7", "\u0394\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03b1", "\u0393\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2", "\u0393\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1", "\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2", "\u038e\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03bf\u03b8\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1", "Reception", "Western ideals", "Western models", "Women's press", "Female subjectivity", "Situated knowledges", "Late ottoman empire"], "types": [], "year": 201812, "oai": "oai:Elocus.tkl:dlib/2/3/8/metadata-dlib-1551269780-55355-27418.tkl", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "190333126", "authors": ["Jackson, Kyle A."], "contributors": ["Brody, Jean"], "description": "The purpose of this this thesis is to investigate and examine the effects of gentrification on the African American arts and culture scene in the city of Washington, D.C. This study seeks to prove that the effects of gentrification contributed heavily to the displacement of the city\u2019s Black population, while simultaneously contributing to the decline of African-American arts and culture in the city, and disturbing the lives and careers of the African-American artists who call Washington, D.C. home. The study discusses gentrification in the general sense, and moves on to discuss gentrification in the city of Washington, D.C. specifically. The thesis covers the various ways in which gentrification has contributed to the removal and attempted eradication of various examples of African American arts and culture in the city, primarily in its visual arts and music sectors, while questioning the authenticity of other attempts to preserve culture that, in many ways, seems appropriated. The thesis also discusses the notion that there are fewer available resources and funding opportunities for artists of color in Washington, D.C., while examining recent demographic changes in the city, primarily in areas that once held a Black majority that are now populated heavily by White residents. The thesis concludes with the idea that gentrification does, in many ways, contribute to the decline of African American culture in the city. A way to combat gentrification is to recognize and include the already established community as part of the revitalization process to ensure that the community does not feel deprived.M.S., Arts Administration -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6758", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028682000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343091000, "depositedDate": 1551363654000}, "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "title": "Gentrification and the decline of African American arts and culture in Washington, D.C.", "topics": ["Arts Management", "African American arts", "Culture, Washington D.C.", "Displacement (Psychology)", "Gentrification"], "types": [], "year": 201606, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190333126.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6758", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190333126.pdf"}, {"id": "190329787", "authors": ["Gorsegner, Amanda"], "contributors": [], "description": "The findings presented in this publication suggest that artists and arts administrators have significant roles to play when using the arts to address climate change.

This has important implications for how clinicians, educators, and researchers come to understand the relational well-being of African American lesbian families within socio-historical, cultural and political contexts. Specifically, it has implications for understanding the effects of anti-gay agendas at the intersections of race, gender, sexual orientation, and class.\nThis study utilized a phenomenological methodology with an intersectional perspective to explore the effects of anti-gay discourse, legislation and constitutional amendments on the emotional well-being (i.e., how one feels about their sexual orientation and/or sexual identity) and relational well-being (i.e., how the relationships with others are impacted) of African-American lesbian women. Thirty face-to-face interviews were conducted in the homes and/or communities of the participants in the following states: Pennsylvania (8), North Carolina (8), Maryland (8), New Jersey (4) and the District of Columbia (2).\nAnalysis of the data indicated that the self-identified African American lesbian women who partici-pated in this study were variously affected by anti-gay discourse, legislation and constitutional amendments. The effects of the phenomena ranged from no emotional connection to feelings of a personal affront. The majority of participants felt so disconnected from the movement that, initially, they saw no need to get politi-cally involved. They shared that they did not identify with the marriage equality movement because the issues that were endemic in their lives and the lives of other African Americans in their communities were not a part of the discourse on marriage equality (e.g., economic disparities, afford-able housing and safe communities for their families, equal employment opportunities, quality education for their children, homeless for LGBTQ youth, HIV/AIDS awareness/prevention and legal protections for transgendered individuals). While they sup- ported the main goal of the movement they did not see representations of African American lesbian women and families in the discourse nor in the media campaigns for marriage equality. Therefore, they did not identify with the movement for they viewed it as one based primarily on the agenda of White gay men.\nThis lack of identification with the movement held true for all of the participants unless they found themselves in the midst of a statewide marriage amendment campaign or they became aware of the limited state a federal benefits attached to their legally recognized relationship status (marriage or civil union). These were the turning points for many of the participants. Nearly 57% of the participants had become so incensed by what they viewed as attempts to legislate discrimination and mislead the public regarding the intent of the proposed amendments that they felt compelled to get involved in community organizing and political advocacy for marriage equality. Some of them testified in front of state legislatures and others worked at the polls on Election Day, held fundraisers, worked at phone banks and developed a website where people were invited to share their thoughts and feelings on marriage equality. The website was linked to other sites where people could go to obtain information on marriage equality and the proposed amendment. The participants were driven by a need to educate themselves and the public on the potential benefits and consequences of proposed legislation and public policies.\nThe personal accounts of the African American lesbian women who participated in this study invites the reader to analyze the effects of anti-gay legislation from different viewpoints. For in spite of similar intersecting racial, gendered, and sexual identities; the participants' experiences of the phenomena were shaped by their respective sociocultural, historical, political, and legal contexts, the geographic locations that the participants navigated on a daily basis and their life cycle stages (young children, adult children, no children, and their relationship status). The findings also highlighted how instrumental local and national civil rights organizations (e.g., National Black Justice Coalition, the NAACP and the Human Rights Campaign) were in expanding the discourse on marriage equality to ensure that the diverse voices and faces within LGBTQ communities were an integral part of the movement.\nThe ultimate goal of the study was to center the voices and experiences of African American lesbian women regarding the effects of anti-gay discourses and legislation and to reduce the gap in Couple and Family Therapy professional journals on this segment of the population. Reducing the gap in the literature can contribute to the development of new knowledge on the effects of anti-gay agendas enhancing the ability of clinicians, researchers and social justice advocates to develop culturally sensitive protocols to service the needs of African American lesbian women and their families.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6138", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028578000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343099000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Bridging the Gaps: How Does Anti-Gay Discourse and Legislation Affect the Emotional and Relational Well-Being of African-American Lesbian Women and Family", "topics": ["Family Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201311, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190328744.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6138", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190328744.pdf"}, {"id": "190328209", "authors": ["Brako, Fred"], "contributors": ["Hardy, Kenneth V."], "description": "The experiences of African immigrants to the United States of America are sparsely represented in the literature. Recent research has focused more on Latinos and Asian ethnic minority populations than on African immigrants. Further, given the paucity of research on this population, it is no surprise the limited literature has ignored important factors such as family relationships and marital issues. Therefore, exploring the relationship between gender role beliefs and marital satisfaction among Ghanaian immigrant couples is necessary to help inform and contribute to the literature in Couple and Family Therapy research particularly for a subgroup living in the United States who has been virtually ignored. Acculturation theory was introduced as a framework to facilitate understanding of the relationship between gender role beliefs of Ghanaian immigrant couples and their level of marital satisfaction in the American culture. This study examined these variables with a correlation predictive design using a cross-sectional survey technique of 77 Ghanaian immigrant adult couples currently residing in the tri-state of area of New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. It was hypothesized that Ghanaian immigrant couples who have more congruent gender role beliefs would have higher levels of marital satisfaction. The results indicated to the contrary. Husbands were liberal in their gender role beliefs compared to wives; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Future studies could explore covariates such as ethnic background, level of education, and counseling services. These were good correlates of gender role beliefs and marital satisfaction in the study.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers":

women\u2019s Press, as well as women as subjectivities, engaged themselves in processes of interpretation, deliberation, confrontation, and internalization of western ideals, models and patterns of life. This receptive process is examined either at the level of women\u2019s writing and discursive imprint or at the level of other modes of material/physical or symbolic enunciation of the female Subject. \nWithin the theoretical/methodological framework of the Politics of Location (aka Standpoint Theory) and Situated Knowledges and in the light of feminist poststructuralism, processes of convergence between female and patriarchal discourses and women\u2019s complicity to patriarchy are discussed. In the postcolonial context that emerges from the amalgamation of western and local discourses, I also illustrate the internal conflicts that define women\u2019s discourse and women\u2019s subjectivity and discuss women\u2019s skillful attempts to manipulate western cultural codes or influence western narratives and ideals. Most importantly, I present instances of patriarchal narratives being proficiently employed to become the springboard for the articulation of a discourse that causes ruptures in the private-public bipolar pattern and ultimately reframes women\u2019s social roles and agency in the face of patriarchal norms. \nIn this context, some other more alternative and less conspicuous loci of female agency and self-definition are brought to light. These loci come to question the narrowly rational and dichotomous interpretations of Space and Knowledge. They open up new perspectives towards the construction of a sense of Self that gradually disentangles itself from heteronomy. They bring women\u2019s agency out of historical obscurity and ultimately open up emancipatory pathways in the course of their shifting from the \u2018margins\u2019 towards the center of civil society", "identifiers": ["oai:Elocus.tkl:dlib/2/3/8/metadata-dlib-1551269780-55355-27418.tkl", null], "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "1387", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "E-Locus", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 0, "metadataAdded": 1562666718000, "metadataUpdated": 1611510245000, "depositedDate": 1551277274000}, "subjects": ["text"], "title": "The reception of western ideals and models in the ottoman territories folusing on women's press and female subjectivity: (1870-early 20th century)", "topics": ["\u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03bb\u03b7\u03c8\u03b7", "\u0394\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7", "\u0394\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03b1", "\u0393\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2", "\u0393\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1", "\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2", "\u038e\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03bf\u03b8\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1", "Reception", "Western ideals", "Western models", "Women's press", "Female subjectivity", "Situated knowledges", "Late ottoman empire"], "types": [], "year": 201812, "oai": "oai:Elocus.tkl:dlib/2/3/8/metadata-dlib-1551269780-55355-27418.tkl", "downloadUrl": ""}, {"id": "190332626", "authors": ["Chilton, Gioia Connell"], "contributors": ["Gerber, Nancy"], "description": "This arts-based research study explored the dynamics of expressing positive emotions, within the intersubjective art making process. The study addressed a multifaceted problem involving a gap in knowledge about the process of emotional expression through art making, which is key to therapeutic action in art therapy. The design was arts-based research, as art making was the primary means of inquiry. The philosophy and methodology of arts-based research were employed to explore the emotional aspects of intersubjective experience. Following the traditions of arts based research, the meaning-making capacity of creating art was used to illuminate the process of artistic creation in response to the research questions. The research was conducted following approval by the Drexel University IRB. Five English-speaking adults who were professional art therapists were recruited as key informants. The method of data generation involved an initial two hour Art Interview, followed by reflexive memoing and responsive art-making by the researcher and a subsequent second Art Interview with co-researchers. Methodological credibility procedures consisted of member checking and peer review. The data analysis processes involved: 1) traditional use of qualitative data analysis practices, such as the use of MAXQDA-10 software for coding for themes and 2) arts-based research data analysis methods. The analysis of the interview data, artistic data, artistic responses and a creative synthesis addressed the research question in the form of visual art pieces, poetry, a video, three stories, four themes, and a theoretical model. Overall, the verbal and artistic analysis of the data resulted in thematic categories that represent the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective art therapy relationship. Based upon the findings, the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective context was conceptualized as an iterative process beginning with metaphors of life and nature, the development of trust, revelations of emotion, empathic responses, reflexivity and joint artmaking creating and causing destabilization, deconstruction, reconstruction, and reimagining of perceptions and meanings. An emerging, holistic view of emotions and the transformative capacity of artmaking in a context of relational trust were discussed. Clinical applications included consideration of the therapeutic use of response art and joint artmaking. The limitations of the study were also described, as was methodological criteria for arts-based research. Overall, this expanding discourse helped to identify ways art therapy works. The study achieved its aim by contributing knowledge to our understanding of how emotions emerge, are expressed, and assigned meaning within an art therapy relational context.Ph.D., Creative Arts Therapies -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6128", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028667000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "An Arts-Based Study of the Dynamics of Expressing Positive Emotions within the Intersubjective Art Making Process", "topics": ["Art Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201403, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190332626.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6128", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190332626.pdf"}, {"id": "185255292", "authors": ["Rezende, Juliana Dib"], "contributors": ["Apolin\u00e1rio, Silvia Menicucci de Oliveira Selmi"], "description": "Buscar-se-\u00e1 nesta monografia analisar em que medida a cultura pr\u00f3pria de um pa\u00eds se\r\nchoca com as normas internacionais adotadas na esfera da ONU a respeito de direitos\r\nhumanos, ou seja, o papel do relativismo cultural perante as obriga\u00e7\u00f5es estipuladas pela\r\norganiza\u00e7\u00e3o, neste caso, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Ir\u00e3.

For Blacks in the United States, these circumstances are more profound. Over the past decades, the precipitous decline in Black marriages and the salient upsurge of never married Blacks have stimulated much theoretical focus but few empirical research studies on Black adults' heterosexual coupling unions have been undertaken (Camp, 2002; Dixon, 2009; Pinderhughes, 2002; Tucker, 2003). In order to fill the empirical gaps regarding heterosexual coupling unions among Blacks, this qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological study explored the experiences of 26 never married Black men and women (ages 25-35) in their attempts to cultivate and maintain intimate romantic relationships. Through in-depth, open-ended individual interview approach, this phenomenological study, guided with the theoretical frameworks of Africana Womanism (Hudson-Weems, 2008) and Symbolic Interactionism (Charon, 2007), sought to capture and understand how participants described and interpreted their intimate romantic coupling experiences and relationships. The findings illustrated that the overwhelming majority of the participants desired to be married or be involved in a long-term secure and intimate romantic relationship. The majority of the participants felt that the initial stage of cultivating romantic relationships began with strong unspoken connection and passion because of their common Black racial identity, background and culture. Furthermore, participants expressed that their racial location and history in society also contributed to the difficulties that they experienced in maintaining an intimate romantic relationship. Participants contextualized their experiences of cultivating and maintaining intimate romantic relationships within social-historical context of the imposition of whiteness, the residual effects of slavery around skin color and emotional alienation between Black men and women; socio-cultural context of the rarity of long-term, positive quality Black marriages and relationships as well as internalized racial stereotypes; and socio-structural context of gender imbalance in educational, income and career achievements. The findings illustrated that as a result of pairing within these socio-historical, socio-cultural and socio-structural contexts, never married heterosexual Black men and women appeared to be coupling within a shame-based racial context. Participants, therefore, described their experienced coupling processes to be difficult and labor intensive. Given these revealing findings, implications for future research, clinical training and practice, and social policy are provided.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "identifiers": ["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6124", null], "publisher": "Drexel University", "relations": [], "repositories": [{"id": "2510", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives", "urlHomepage": null, "urlOaipmh": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "source": null, "software": null, "metadataFormat": null, "description": null, "journal": null, "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "disabled": false, "lastUpdateTime": null, "repositoryLocation": null}], "repositoryDocument": {"pdfStatus": 1, "metadataAdded": 1554028502000, "metadataUpdated": 1611343098000, "depositedDate": 1551244790000}, "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "title": "Never Married Heterosexual Black Male-Female Intimate Romantic Experiences: A Phenomenological Study", "topics": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Couples Therapy"], "types": [], "year": 201405, "fulltextIdentifier": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190325411.pdf", "oai": "oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6124", "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190325411.pdf"}]}]
