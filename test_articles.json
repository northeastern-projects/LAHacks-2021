Specifically, recent advances in 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) have explored the possibility of expanding the use of mmWave beyond device communications and simple range sensing to a full-fledged imaging under low visibility conditions (fog, smog, snow, etc.). This thesis explores the use of mmWave imaging for humans, which could be incorporated into autonomous driving technology for pedestrian imaging in low visibility conditions. Unfortunately, certain challenges have been identified in mmWave imaging for humans, including its low resolution, the presence of fake artifacts resulting from multipath reflections, and the vibration of the human body. This thesis presents a system that can enable high-resolution mmWave imaging for humans that tries to address the above challenges by leveraging recent advances in deep learning, known as generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this thesis, we propose a GAN architecture that is customized to mmWave imaging and build a system that can significantly enhance the quality of mmWave images for humans.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "position": {"x": -0.3826984110182509, "y": 0.7310503190496639, "z": -0.03911669611022914}, "dissimilarity": [0.0, 3.1293156147003174, 3.450164556503296, 4.975581645965576, 4.379672050476074, 3.216681480407715, 4.380447864532471, 5.567908763885498, 4.078155517578125, 3.4632198810577393, 3.1107423305511475, 3.676097869873047, 3.131298065185547, 3.0920183658599854, 4.679551601409912, 5.036943435668945, 3.8925023078918457, 4.727446556091309, 3.2578351497650146, 3.588705539703369, 3.5684845447540283, 3.3595492839813232, 4.551424980163574, 4.728816509246826, 3.8389148712158203, 5.345143795013428, 3.674207925796509, 3.1494338512420654, 4.310852527618408, 5.983288764953613, 4.288660526275635, 4.32015323638916, 4.826198577880859, 3.597862720489502, 3.74955677986145, 4.219303131103516, 4.307633399963379]}, {"title": "Predicting effect of force using game engine synthesized dataset", "description": "This research aims to solve the problem of predicting the long-term sequential movements of an object in an image given a force vector applied to the object.

Neuroscientists and sleep experts work every day to understand how and what makes sleep more effective in its physical and mental recovery action. Among the most adopted techniques, the standard for the measurement of vital parameters on sleeping subjects is certainly Polysomnography. It is a method that involves many sensors and a laboratory environment, factors that introduce inconveniences that could negatively influence the sleep of the individual himself. In this thesis we will base the experimentation on signals obtained through Ballistocardiography, a portable and less intrusive technique that deduces the heartbeat and respiratory acts based on the accelerations of the body lying on the bed due to forces imparted by the heart to the mass of blood that is pumped to the peripheral body systems. In order to solve the problem of the parametric complexity of explicit analytical models of sleep quality in terms of \"sleep architecture\", in this work we propose a Deep Learning architecture based on multiple levels of Stigmergic Perceptrons. This approach describes a soft classification technique on time series with respect to a collection of archetypes, each representing a different behavioral class. Finally, the Deep Learning architecture is integrated with recurrent Long Short-Term Memory networks, known in literature for the classification of time series, above all for their ability to solve the problem of long-term dependencies over time. This technology is appropriate in order to establish a classifier able to recognize the level of quality of sleep declared by the subjects of the measurements and confirmed by a result obtained through the application of quantitative heuristics.

Neuroscienziati ed esperti del sonno si adoperano ogni giorno per capire come e cosa renda il sonno pi\u00f9 efficace nella sua azione di recupero fisico e mentale. Tra le tecniche pi\u00f9 adottate, lo standard per le misurazioni dei parametri vitali su soggetti addormentati \u00e8 sicuramente la Polisonnografia. Si tratta di un metodo che prevede molti sensori e un ambiente di laboratorio, fattori che introducono scomodit\u00e0 che potrebbero influenzare negativamente il sonno dell'individuo stesso. In questa tesi baseremo la sperimentazione su segnali ottenuti tramite Ballistocardiografia, una tecnica portabile e meno intrusiva che deduce il battito cardiaco e gli atti respiratori in base alle accelerazioni del corpo giacente sul letto dovute a forze impartite dal cuore alla massa di sangue che viene pompata ai sistemi periferici del corpo. Al fine di risolvere il problema della complessit\u00e0 parametrica dei modelli analitici espliciti della qualit\u00e0 del sonno in termini di \"architettura del sonno\", in questo lavoro si propone una architettura di Apprendimento Profondo basata su pi\u00f9 livelli di Percettroni Stigmergici. Questo approccio descrive una tecnica di classificazione soft su serie temporali rispetto ad una raccolta di archetipi, ciascuno rappresentante una differente classe comportamentale. In fine, all'architettura di Apprendimento Profondo si integra l'uso di reti ricorrenti Long Short-Term Memory, note in letteratura per la classificazione di serie temporali soprattutto per la loro capacit\u00e0 di risolvere il problema delle dipendenze a lungo termine nel tempo. Questa tecnologia si rende opportuna allo scopo di costituire un classificatore in grado di riconoscere il livello di qualit\u00e0 del sonno dichiarato dai soggetti delle misurazioni e confermato da un risultato ottenuto tramite applicazione di euristiche quantitative.

This problem is of practical significance due to security concerns about models deployed in industry, and of theoretical significance due to the connections between this problem and the underlying themes of optimization and generalization. In this paper, we propose and analyze a simple and computationally efficient defense against adversarial attacks based on randomized discretization to a relatively small set of points that is agnostic of the underlying classifier. We show that that this strategy leads to a lower bound on the classification accuracy using tools from computational geometry and information theory.

Abstract This thesis work is the result of a five-month internship, included in a talent-program called Junior Consulting promoted by ELIS Consulting & Labs, in Rome. During this period, the candidate took part in a consulting project aimed at using Image Analytics tools for the proper management of sensitive data which are usually processed in insurance companies\u2019 business processes, in order to be compliant with the GDPR European regulation. In this respect, the need has emerged for the implementation of an Object Detection algorithm, also aimed to remove license plates, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN), and persons from images used for insurance purposes, by relying on the supervised learning of deep neural networks. The technological part was realized using the TensorFlow framework, which allowed to implement a customized RetinaNet model in line with the anonymization task requirements that were specifically sought by the project client. In addition, the work carried out during the project provided the basis for further context analysis. The object of this additional survey concerns the possible ways of leveraging the most recent artificial intelligence tools in insurance business processes, in order to support a digital transformation strategy focused on value deriving from meaningful interpretation and management of data. The results which were obtained from the literature review show how the implementation of machine learning-based and deep learning-based tools allow insurance companies to improve their data-driven processes, unlocking value from the analysis of both structured and unstructured data (e.g., images). The benefits of this approach are expected to be measured in the medium/long run, in terms of positive impact on the customer satisfaction key performance indicators in the insurance domain", "position": {"x": 0.5925645482674818, "y": -2.459708851295104, "z": -3.670910858390716}, "dissimilarity": [5.567908763885498, 5.576394557952881, 5.1248979568481445, 2.129329204559326, 4.379865646362305, 6.102191925048828, 5.853221893310547, 0.0, 5.604778289794922, 5.617283344268799, 5.707379341125488, 5.856334686279297, 5.783504009246826, 5.867365837097168, 6.120216369628906, 6.525428771972656, 6.181286334991455, 6.560976505279541, 5.8982954025268555, 5.970390319824219, 5.491212844848633, 5.648593902587891, 5.963655471801758, 3.9447824954986572, 6.175037384033203, 4.336589813232422, 5.724911212921143, 5.640611171722412, 6.151061534881592, 2.62858247756958, 5.411446571350098, 5.767531394958496, 6.073052406311035, 6.10589075088501, 4.472763538360596, 5.563937664031982, 5.821974277496338]}, {"title": "Industrial Strength Multilingual Named Entity Collection for the SPIRIT Project", "description": "Scalable privacy preserving intelligence analysis for resolving identities (SPIRIT) is a Cybersecurity and OSINT project which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 786993.

Distributed learning was done on a client-server architecture where each client is an individual learner training on his or her own dataset and the server exchanges gradients between learners. Each learner used a convolutional neural network to learn the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits). Only gradients are exchanged instead of training data resulting in some privacy, but additional privacy was added by multiplying random weights to these gradients. The first step of the research was to replicate results from Shokri and Shmatikov\u2019s 2015 paper on privacy-preserving deep Learning. Shokri and Shmatikov\u2019s paper primarily worked with multiple clients and a single server. The research extends this architecture by creating a multiple server and multiple client architecture and adding random weights to the gradients. The research successfully produced empirical results showcasing the effectiveness of our distributed machine learning algorithm since it was able to maintain an acceptable classification accuracy while providing a certain degree of privacy.

Unlike CPUs which have been targets of security exploits since their inception (many decades ago) GPUs have only been available for a diverse set of applications and widely adopted in the last decade. Due to GPUs relative novelty and increasing adoption by industry and government alike, there has been an increased interest in security vulnerabilities and their corresponding solutions. In this thesis we uncover a vulnerability with the library clock function that can cause device-wide slowdown on Unix-based systems, impact performance and, in some cases, cause total system failure. Different generations of CUDA devices running on different operating systems were benchmarked. The disturbances in the benchmark output demonstrated consistent vulnerabilities in Unix systems and some occasional problems with Windows systems.

We demonstrated in this paper that YOLOv3 outperforms Faster R-CNN in sensitivity and processing time, although they are comparable in the precision metric.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio", "position": {"x": -2.1968465033525013, "y": 0.49219859896964707, "z": 1.2508864585440347}, "dissimilarity": [3.0920183658599854, 3.4597465991973877, 3.6939690113067627, 5.2801666259765625, 4.693497180938721, 3.5645689964294434, 4.7443084716796875, 5.867365837097168, 4.13233757019043, 3.9250082969665527, 3.7473957538604736, 4.134427547454834, 3.700533628463745, 0.0, 4.698116302490234, 4.896867752075195, 4.065284252166748, 4.572084426879883, 3.6964972019195557, 3.9996156692504883, 4.093939304351807, 3.717195749282837, 4.609792232513428, 5.013947486877441, 3.3783469200134277, 5.660243034362793, 3.8084163665771484, 3.3323516845703125, 4.105635643005371, 6.3176116943359375, 4.937010288238525, 4.983962535858154, 4.399769306182861, 3.8507633209228516, 4.127868175506592, 4.412691593170166, 4.271213054656982]}, {"title": "An assessment of automatic segmentation of the knee joint based on machine learning", "description": "The creation of an accurate 3D model of the bone and joint is a crucial requirement for any CAOS system, and the basis for any and all surgical planning. This model can be obtained by using image-based or image-free techniques. Image-based techniques rely on the segmentation of pre-operative scans. Segmentation is typically done manually, which is a time-consuming process that requires technical expertise. Image-free techniques were developed to avoid this preoperative step and rely on intraoperative surface scanning and bone morphing algorithms to create a patient-specific model during surgery. Recent advances in machine learning have aided the development of novel segmentation algorithms, which may eventually enable automation of the segmentation process in image-based techniques. In this work, we assessed the accuracy of digital models of a cadaveric femur obtained using three different systems (manual segmentation, a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm and a commercial image-free surgical system), by comparing them to high resolution optical scans of the exposed femur, which is used here as the gold standard. One cadaveric knee was used for this study. Ethical approval was obtained from the Imperial College Healthcare Tissue Bank (project R13066-3A) and the cadaveric knee was sourced from an approved supplier. The intact sample was scanned using a Siemens Spectra MRI system to obtain the images needed for the image-based procedures. Manual segmentation of the femur bone and cartilage was performed in 3D-Slicer by thresholding, followed by manual adjustment. A 3D model of the segmented volume was then generated using the same software. The automated segmentation was performed using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed by Kayalibay et al. The neural network was trained to classify voxels into five categories (femur bone, femur cartilage, tibia bone, tibia cartilage, other) using 70 MRI volumes of the knee, available from the SKI10 challenge. Training required approximately 41 hours on an NVIDIA Tesla K80 Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). After training, the same neural network was used to segment an MRI scan of the specimen. The label maps obtained from the network were then converted into a 3D model using Matlab R2018a. The knee specimen was prepared for optical surface scanning by attaching it to a custom-made metal rig using bone cement and exposing the distal end of the femur by performing a vertical cut as in a Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). To obtain a gold standard measurement, 12 high resolution scans of the visible part of the femur head were obtained from different positions and orientations, using a Polyga HDI C210 3D Scanner. The scans were then aligned and merged using the FlexScan3D software, available from the camera manufacturer. The specimen was then digitised using a commercial image-free surgical system. To this end, a reference array was attached to the femur using bone pins and, after standard calibration, the visible part of the femur was digitised using the system\u2019s probe. After this, the system\u2019s log files were downloaded to a USB drive to access the computed surface model. The 3D models obtained with the different modalities were imported into Matlab as point clouds and were registered to the gold standard using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method. To summarise the accuracy of each method, the root mean square error (RMSE) was computed for each modality. Manual segmentation is confirmed here to be the most accurate method, but it requires expertise and time. Hence, in order to alleviate the task for clinicians, image-free systems have gained in popularity. Our results show that the accuracy of a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm is still worse than with other methods, but inching towards the ballpark figure for image-free systems, albeit with the need for preoperative imaging of the patient, which would add time and cost to a navigated procedure. These results suggest that machine-learning methods could become a powerful alternative to currently available segmentation techniques.

Viruses have always been part of the human life, however the evolution of the society towards a more globalized one has meant that the spread of these pathogens have become quicker. Many of such human pathogens have a mammalian and avian origin, when such transmission happens there is the so called spillover. Wild animals live together their own viruses from thousands of years and with evolution have developed an appropriate immune system to face them. The climatic change and the destruction of natural habitats increases the contact between wildlife and humans. This way, the spillover probability increases, exposing humans to unknown viruses with potentially catastrophic outcomes. Recent examples of such events are the filovirus Ebola (discovered for the first time in 1976 in Zaire), the coronavirus SARS (2003) and MERS (2012) and the bird flu.

The diagnostic power of an ECG is related to the ability to timely and accurately identify specific heartbeat alterations (arrhythmia). Several approaches to the automated analysis of ECG signals have been proposed so far, in the attempt to improve the quality of arrhythmia detection. The ECG signal, like many other biological signals, is generally non-linear, non-stationary, dynamic and complex: this hampers the extraction of characteristics to be used for any algorithmic analysis, with a severe impact on the efficiency of the overall diagnostic procedure. Specifically, the complexity of the ECG signal is related to the high variability of wave-form morphologies both for the same patient and across different patients, plus problems in the placements of electrodes on the patient\u2019s body. This work aims to increase the accuracy and speed of ECG diagnostic systems with respect to the real-time detection of arrhythmia events. A deep learning (DL) approach is proposed as a means to deal with the high variability in ECG signals. The implemented neural network has shown to be able to detect, starting from raw data, high-level ECG characteristics, with good generalization ability. The work is developed according to an \"intra-patient\" paradigm: the network is trained not only using generic samples, but also exploiting patient-specific data. The network consists of three convolutional layers, which are in charge of extracting features out of morphological information in ECG signals; subsequently, by considering also temporal features, the previous information is fed to a multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) to finalize the classification job. The performance evaluation of the developed classifier has been carried out taking into account different pre-processing strategies, best representation of morphological and temporal features, data augmentation techniques and fine-tuning strategies. The results over a classical, standard benchmark database (MIT-BIH DB), show that the network performance is comparable (and in some cases superior) to what it has been obtained in other works with the same paradigm. In accordance with the AAMI recommendations, the most challenging classes to identify are the Supraventricular Ectopic Beat (SVEB) and the Ventricular Ectopic Beat (VEB). For this reason, the performance on this class, based on Sensitivity (Sen) and Positive predicted value (Ppv), are representative of the effective robustness of the overall approach. The network reaches 60.21% and 79.85% for the SVEB class and 91.05% and 95.34% for the VEB class in terms of Sen and Ppv respectively. Such results show the competitive performance of this work with respect to the state-of-the-art. Finally, it is important to underline that the shallow depth of the network, as well as the limited number of steps to get to the final classification of input data, make the proposed system particularly well suited for real-time analysis in embedded devices", "position": {"x": 1.8212549222874996, "y": -1.2217902554124218, "z": 3.2609681173795426}, "dissimilarity": [4.727446556091309, 4.574949741363525, 3.51452898979187, 5.953195571899414, 5.631092548370361, 4.851318359375, 4.446404933929443, 6.560976505279541, 5.217077732086182, 5.035094738006592, 4.6289472579956055, 5.539575576782227, 4.510401248931885, 4.572084426879883, 3.638519287109375, 5.699167728424072, 5.186252117156982, 0.0, 4.871312141418457, 5.053201198577881, 4.954207897186279, 5.051775932312012, 5.221536159515381, 5.870741844177246, 3.6344783306121826, 6.299254894256592, 4.9717512130737305, 5.096004486083984, 3.75801682472229, 6.817258358001709, 5.075732707977295, 5.038661479949951, 5.719197750091553, 4.867557525634766, 5.188806533813477, 5.565762519836426, 4.134317874908447]}, {"title": "Multi-task Deep Learning in the Software Development domain", "description": "Nowadays, almost every aspect of life depends on reliable high-quality software so there is a high demand for software tools that could help this development process.

Since probabilistic reasoning and inference is a foundational technology of statistical learning programs, adoption of probabilistic programming systems has been growing in the past few years. Pyro is a commonly used probabilistic programming system written in Python that is based on the PyTorch deep learning framework and has become very popular for machine learning applications. However, since Pyro uses a deep learning framework to sample from distributions, there is a need to evaluate the approximate nature of computations and the resilience of probabilistic programs. Additionally, there is also a significant need to systemically test probabilistic programs to identify major errors. In this thesis, we systemically evaluate, test, and analyze Pyro probabilistic inference functions and programs. Since mutation testing is a well-established approach to test software against fault injections, we apply mutations to Pyro inference functions by using MutPy, a mutation testing tool for Python programs. Specifically, we use three popular inference programs as our testing suite and conduct mutation injection experiments on the Pyro inference library. Next, we analyze the data corruption and the amount of error introduced by mutations on inference programs. We provide a collective study of mutation tolerance of Pyro inference functions and programs where we also analyze mutation operators of MutPy and high-order mutations.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "position": {"x": -1.3052393378002594, "y": 2.0252981148799165, "z": 1.9542823120075086}, "dissimilarity": [3.588705539703369, 3.4365744590759277, 4.037564277648926, 5.392366409301758, 5.004694938659668, 2.7331833839416504, 4.8880157470703125, 5.970390319824219, 4.652491092681885, 3.5629215240478516, 3.472038745880127, 3.6184535026550293, 3.758455514907837, 3.9996156692504883, 5.247060775756836, 5.3216166496276855, 4.707165241241455, 5.053201198577881, 3.021564483642578, 0.0, 3.813997268676758, 3.5717740058898926, 4.844305515289307, 5.443270206451416, 4.1985039710998535, 5.9614996910095215, 4.291801452636719, 4.0819525718688965, 4.270513534545898, 6.398126602172852, 4.70274019241333, 4.787325382232666, 5.081245422363281, 2.5016090869903564, 4.508153915405273, 4.345578193664551, 4.500080108642578]}, {"title": "Deep chain learning collusions over network with improved blockchain security", "description": "Smart contracts in blockchains can be executed for identifying and verifying images, text, signatures, information within forms and legal documents, etc., by collusions over network, benefitting various industry use cases. The identifications and verifications for digital identity currently follow a centralized architecture and may or may not include deep learning technologies with more secured data-centric authentications - a gap in the overall paradigm. This leads to bottlenecks with security issues involving many concurrent processes with many concurrent parties, resulting in longer service times and a lack of trust, thus impacting the overall Quality of Service (QoS). This thesis introduces a concept called \u201cDeep Chain Learning,\u201d which provides a secured technique for integrating deep learning within smart contracts in a blockchain in a decentralized architecture. The smart contracts trigger execution of neural network-based models for deep learning on component images, signatures, etc., by each or some of the parties at respective nodes in a blockchain. A user-authentication mechanism allows for accessing different object components by each party in the blockchain to execute deep learning. The inference results drawn from each of these parties are written to the blockchain, and shared across all parties. The implementation of \u201cDeep Chain Learning\u201d uses an example driver\u2019s license identification and verification process, as part of an auto insurance application. It also enables user access control privileges as a security measure for deep chain learning. Performance is evaluated for three use cases including auto insurance and healthcare applications. Results show that the distribution of inference tasks of component images among multiple parties lead to an almost linear reduction in cost, when compared to the control variable, which is a centralized, sequential mode of execution. The solution not only reduces the QoS, but with the security feature enabled, improves the overall trust in the paradigm.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "position": {"x": 0.4077926830009697, "y": 2.738767230501207, "z": -0.8415867094235423}, "dissimilarity": [3.5684845447540283, 3.668549060821533, 4.354455471038818, 5.048093795776367, 4.847009181976318, 3.713399648666382, 4.768712520599365, 5.491212844848633, 3.769063711166382, 4.422765254974365, 3.4407265186309814, 3.3965003490448, 3.9099326133728027, 4.093939304351807, 5.025209426879883, 5.581988334655762, 4.273778915405273, 4.954207897186279, 3.910794734954834, 3.813997268676758, 0.0, 3.2449872493743896, 5.0320539474487305, 5.1620049476623535, 4.477969169616699, 5.587843418121338, 3.3676419258117676, 4.142665386199951, 4.592402935028076, 6.1400933265686035, 4.56030797958374, 4.649267673492432, 5.287056922912598, 3.8831889629364014, 4.707183837890625, 4.302535057067871, 4.985753536224365]}, {"title": "DIMA system for real-time object detention", "description": "In recent years, breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning have shown their unlimited potential in autonomous driving, unmanned stores, etc. However, their superior capabilities come with high computational costs. While these techniques can achieve reasonable performance on servers or workstations equipped with multiple GPUs, they cannot be easily deployed on edge or IoT platforms. This challenge demands a computationally efficient solution to enable machine learning or deep learning for the edge. Towards this goal, this research focused on developing a system to accelerate video inference by utilizing deep in memory architecture (DIMA) ICs designed and prototyped recently in our research group. The DIMA IC embeds mixed-signal compute blocks within SRAM memory array to accelerate machine learning models for image classification with 3.1x higher power efficiency and 2.1x lower inference latency. While DIMA IC achieved fast inference on single cropped images, its overall test setup was not optimized for video inference. To address this issue, we replaced the original MCU + PC in the previous setup with a Raspberry Pi and enabled it to directly process image information and control the chip. As a result, the system performance improved from more than 10 seconds per image to around 13 ms inference time. This also enabled us to complete the system with real camera input. With frames streaming into the Raspberry Pi, it will preprocess the image and regional proposal for the chip. The chip will accelerate the image classification process and provide the system with real-time object recognition capability.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for general acces", "position": {"x": 0.17092423377787827, "y": 2.7309318100515165, "z": 0.4530001020754316}, "dissimilarity": [3.3595492839813232, 3.2712769508361816, 4.472334861755371, 4.9823150634765625, 4.7919440269470215, 3.6498098373413086, 4.7268595695495605, 5.648593902587891, 3.7394747734069824, 4.01008939743042, 3.425191640853882, 2.950787305831909, 3.4762122631073, 3.717195749282837, 4.7463507652282715, 5.376790523529053, 3.6901023387908936, 5.051775932312012, 3.6264760494232178, 3.5717740058898926, 3.2449872493743896, 0.0, 5.080807209014893, 5.0755228996276855, 3.9101979732513428, 5.686923027038574, 2.925046443939209, 3.6721036434173584, 4.240354537963867, 6.1118669509887695, 4.93786096572876, 4.811127662658691, 4.938235759735107, 3.7122879028320312, 4.808547019958496, 4.011455059051514, 4.954790115356445]}, {"title": "Activity Monitoring of Islamic Prayer (Salat) Postures using Deep Learning", "description": "In the Muslim community, the prayer (i.e. Salat) is the second pillar of Islam, and it is the most essential and fundamental worshiping activity that believers have to perform five times a day. From a gestures' perspective, there are predefined human postures that must be performed in a precise manner. However, for several people, these postures are not correctly performed, due to being new to Salat or even having learned prayers in an incorrect manner. Furthermore, the time spent in each posture has to be balanced. To address these issues, we propose to develop an artificial intelligence assistive framework that guides worshippers to evaluate the correctness of the postures of their prayers. This paper represents the first step to achieve this objective and addresses the problem of the recognition of the basic gestures of Islamic prayer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The contribution of this paper lies in building a dataset for the basic Salat positions, and train a YOLOv3 neural network for the recognition of the gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that the mean average precision attains 85% for a training dataset of 764 images of the different postures.

Monitoring of animal life with image recognition in natural habitats is essential for animal health and production. Currently, Sheep Pain Facial Expression Scale (SPFES) has become the focus of monitoring sheep from facial expression. In contrast, pain level estimation from facial expression is an efficient and reliable mark of animal life. However, the manual assessment is lack of accuracy, time-consuming, and monotonous. Hence, the recent advancement of deep learning in computer vision helps to classify facial expression as fast and accurate. In this paper, we proposed a sheep face dataset and framework that uses transfer learning with fine-tuning for automating the classification of normal (no pain) and abnormal (pain) sheep face images. Current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) based architectures are used to train the sheep face dataset. The data augmentation, L2 regularization, and fine-tuning has been used to prepare the models. The experimental results related to the sheep facial expression dataset achieved 100% training, 99.69% validation, and 100% testing accuracy using the VGG16 model. While employing other pre-trained models, we gained 93.10% to 98.4% accuracy.

Moreover, additional constraints are set by the peculiarities of niche market applications, whose reduced sales volumes and intrinsic requirements often prevent R&D prototypes from improving their technology maturity. Because of that, in this work, we investigate the design of DSP-based systems with respect to several case studies in the field of space and assistive technology. In the field of assistive technology, our research questions involve the implementation of a portable Voice User Interface (VUI) for Italian speakers with severe dysarthria and the design of a low-effort Human-Machine Interface to control a power wheelchair-mounted manipulator to assist people with upper-limb disabilities. In the field of space applications, we faced the problem of the limited downlink throughput of Earth Observation (EO) satellites through the deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on board space-craft to compress their downlink data.

To facilitate prostate cancer diagnosis, we built and trained binary classifiers using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on two datasets: one contains cancerous and healthy biopsy images of prostate tissues (referred as Dataset1), and the other contains biopsy images of tissues with recurred cancer and fully recovered tissues (referred as Dataset2). We extracted patches from biopsy images of human tissues, then built and trained CNN models to classify the patches. We achieved 82% test accuracy on Dataset1 and 63% accuracy on Dataset2. In addition, we used ensemble methods to further boost the performance. With predictions of all patches in our datasets, we performed majority voting on the image level, and the accuracy increases by 5% to 10% on the first dataset. Then we used Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging) to further increase accuracy to 100% on Dataset1. However, the two-step ensemble methods above have little influence on the accuracy of Dataset2. When visualizing the predictions on the second dataset returned by our models, no clear patterns are found that can distinguish the two classes.U of I Onlyundergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "position": {"x": 0.23329692320143924, "y": -1.2594941727373306, "z": 3.019426591254179}, "dissimilarity": [4.310852527618408, 4.135000228881836, 3.840691566467285, 5.595181465148926, 5.399022102355957, 4.348055362701416, 3.6681759357452393, 6.151061534881592, 5.261329174041748, 3.9632089138031006, 4.156991958618164, 5.0272932052612305, 3.9806838035583496, 4.105635643005371, 3.5800230503082275, 5.467883586883545, 5.1454901695251465, 3.75801682472229, 4.4519734382629395, 4.270513534545898, 4.592402935028076, 4.240354537963867, 5.267332553863525, 5.58022928237915, 3.5072803497314453, 6.069477081298828, 4.629874229431152, 4.448700904846191, 0.0, 6.516510009765625, 5.172795295715332, 4.767767906188965, 5.007562637329102, 3.9448165893554688, 4.989147663116455, 4.778973579406738, 3.766042470932007]}, {"title": "Analisi della voce attraverso le Reti Neurali: applicazione di software nello screening delle disfonie.", "description": "Background.

It recognizes the sensitive relationship between knowing and emotions. The concept was devised by Robert Jerome Starratt in a dissertation entitled, The Individual and the Educated Imagination: An Essay in Curriculum Theory, which was accepted by the Graduate College of the University of Illinois in 1969. Building on the Starratt concepts which were geared for a secondary school curriculum, this study attempts to identify the factors influencing elementary school climates which promote the learning experiences described in the first sentence. Two elementary schools were studied which might be placed at opposite ends of a continuum ranging economically from poor to affluent. The study is concerned with multiple forces affecting the schools over the ten year period, from the filing of the Starratt dissertation to the completion of the present study. The study focused on such broad influences as declining enrollments, desegregation and political forces which are changing the course of education in the United States.The study advances the premise that curriculum theory and program changes are not likely to succeed unless the underlying forces affecting the educational climate are understood and controlled. The study also suggests that one of the best hopes for achieving the kinds of knowing interlaced with feeling is through improvements in the teacher education process. The value of university laboratory schools in this process is carefully explored. Finally, the delicate relationship between available resources, number of positions, change and the conservation of the school's heritage is a primary concern. The study concludes with the presentation of an administrative strategy or guidelines designed to produce the desired learnings.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "position": {"x": 2.7590825898470275, "y": -1.4902767313071805, "z": -0.5169465527465229}, "dissimilarity": [4.288660526275635, 4.380529880523682, 3.806461811065674, 5.066699981689453, 4.39686918258667, 4.549393177032471, 4.660665512084961, 5.411446571350098, 4.831540584564209, 4.467877388000488, 4.132500171661377, 5.004019260406494, 4.662143230438232, 4.937010288238525, 5.124495029449463, 5.577978134155273, 5.5115647315979, 5.075732707977295, 4.248499870300293, 4.70274019241333, 4.56030797958374, 4.93786096572876, 4.542405605316162, 4.938425064086914, 4.782036781311035, 4.923109531402588, 4.909412860870361, 4.846790790557861, 5.172795295715332, 5.536313056945801, 0.0, 3.7005274295806885, 5.552085876464844, 4.6724629402160645, 4.419399261474609, 5.070353984832764, 4.781494140625]}, {"title": "Students' Learning Approaches and Their Understanding of Some Chemical Concepts in Eighth-Grade Science", "description": "303 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1997.Analysis of the target students' discourse and actions during the group activities and their interview responses revealed differences between the deep and surface learning approaches regarding generative thinking, nature of explanations, asking questions, metacognitive activity, and approach to tasks. Strategies associated with a deep learning approach included generating mental images and analogies, hypothesizing, thought experimenting and predicting possible outcomes, self-explaining and theorizing, invoking personal experiences and prior knowledge and applying them to new situations, asking questions, thinking of specific examples, and looking for coherence by seeking patterns and relating different aspects of the task. When students used a deep approach, they also constantly monitored and self-evaluated the status of their comprehension, self-questioned, self-corrected their errors, attended to contradictory information, considered limitations in their own or others' ideas and critiqued them.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "position": {"x": 3.460286661096061, "y": -0.39780968470437705, "z": 0.3454306181224293}, "dissimilarity": [4.32015323638916, 4.128565788269043, 4.020384788513184, 5.143202304840088, 4.8603105545043945, 4.785196781158447, 4.944508075714111, 5.767531394958496, 5.331027507781982, 4.270041465759277, 4.067931175231934, 5.164353370666504, 4.2237138748168945, 4.983962535858154, 5.137357711791992, 5.929628849029541, 5.4101948738098145, 5.038661479949951, 4.462342739105225, 4.787325382232666, 4.649267673492432, 4.811127662658691, 4.854849815368652, 5.508327007293701, 4.636679649353027, 5.275129795074463, 4.825894832611084, 4.935283660888672, 4.767767906188965, 5.935194492340088, 3.7005274295806885, 0.0, 5.5448102951049805, 4.682576656341553, 4.749292850494385, 4.527869701385498, 5.13548469543457]}, {"title": "AI-based Pilgrim Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks", "description": "Pilgrimage represents the most important Islamic religious gathering in the world where millions of pilgrims visit the holy places of Makkah and Madinah to perform their rituals. The safety and security of pilgrims is the highest priority for the authorities. In Makkah, 5000 cameras are spread around the holy mosques for monitoring pilgrims, but it is almost impossible to track all events by humans considering the huge number of images collected every second. To address this issue, we propose to use an artificial intelligence technique based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks to detect and identify Pilgrims and their features. For this purpose, we built a comprehensive dataset for the detection of pilgrims and their genders.

Training deep learning agents that are capable of interacting with proof assistants provide a novel way of developing automated theorem proving (ATP) systems. We observe that existing methods in this field, either supervised learning methods or RL, are all based on locality assumptions\u2013the agent generates proof tactics conditioning only on the information in the most recent time step, discarding any information in previous time steps. However, the correctness of such assumptions has never been verified. We propose a method that introduces global information in training deep-learning based ATP models. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (a) we construct a LSTM-like memory mechanism across time steps for deep learning-based ATP agents, and (b) we build a pipeline for end-to-end training by constructing a differentiable estimation of the proof assistant, which can be viewed as a discrete function. We show the effectiveness of our method by building on the state-of-the-art ATP model, ASTatics.U of I OnlyUndergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "position": {"x": -0.6920592338155551, "y": 1.4227676281245074, "z": 2.579815975031142}, "dissimilarity": [3.597862720489502, 3.6006596088409424, 3.985018730163574, 5.6239447593688965, 5.047573566436768, 2.6502106189727783, 4.957279682159424, 6.10589075088501, 4.382740497589111, 3.3970139026641846, 3.3912978172302246, 4.184874057769775, 3.51926851272583, 3.8507633209228516, 5.100445747375488, 5.598965644836426, 4.462615489959717, 4.867557525634766, 2.9941823482513428, 2.5016090869903564, 3.8831889629364014, 3.7122879028320312, 4.88413143157959, 5.675193786621094, 4.0206379890441895, 6.043260097503662, 4.15333890914917, 3.8211467266082764, 3.9448165893554688, 6.610800266265869, 4.6724629402160645, 4.682576656341553, 5.189270973205566, 0.0, 4.469641208648682, 4.603675365447998, 4.260495185852051]}, {"title": "Generative Models of Human Mobility based on Deep Learning", "description": "Goal of the thesis is the generation of synthetic human mobility based on Deep Learning.

This time involved working for ModernMT speedups. We spent this time gathering existing resources on ways to speedup a NMT model. We filtered the ones suited better for ModernMT and we experimented the approaches on it. We were looking for approaches we can apply on ModernMT, which also works on the GPUs that we have in production. I spent the rest two months working on a future product MateDub which is under development currently. MateDub aims at performing automatic video dubbing using Artificial Intelligence. In both of these projects, I worked on primarily on AWS instances. Most of my work was carried on on-demand and spot instances of g4dn and p3 with Tesla and Volta GPU architectures respectively. Finally, work was tried on production GPUs of the company (production GPUs). The Deep Learning tasks were done in Python mainly using PyTorch libraries. The GPU profiling/debugging and programming tasks were performed using NVIDIA Nsight, NVIDIA Compute, NVTX-python and NVIDIA TensorRT. The data related tasks were performed using Python and Audacity.

Among patients with cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarction is the main cause of death. In order to provide adequate healthcare support to patients who may experience this clinical event, it is essential to gather supportive evidence in a timely manner to help secure a correct diagnosis. In this thesis we design domain-inspired neural network models, trained, tested and validated with the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) data set, to conduct a series of studies. First, acknowledging that the identification of suggestive electrocardiographic (ECG) changes may help in the classification of heart conditions, we adapt the ConvNetQuake neural network model---originally designed to identify earthquakes---to train, validate and test neural network models that take in from one to several ECG leads. This systematic analysis, first of its kind in the literature, indicates that out of 15 ECG leads, data from the v6, vz, and ii leads are critical to correctly identify myocardial infarction. Second, we show that using two independent train-validation-test data splits, namely, record-wise and patient-wise, does not change the finding that the combination of the leads v6, vz, and ii provides the best classification results for myocardial infarction, achieving 99.43% classification accuracy on a record-wise split, and 97.83% classification accuracy on a patient-wise split. These two results represent cardiologist-level performance for myocardial infarction detection after feeding only 10 seconds of raw ECG data into our multi-ECG-channel (v6-vz-ii) neural network model. Third, we show that our multi-ECG-channel neural network model achieves cardiologist-level performance without the need of any kind of manual feature extraction or data pre-processing.U of I OnlyUndergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "position": {"x": -0.4628404498603971, "y": -2.735276353583275, "z": 1.7771282331876448}, "dissimilarity": [4.307633399963379, 4.546657562255859, 3.6839041709899902, 5.341111183166504, 4.871465682983398, 4.503316402435303, 4.335175514221191, 5.821974277496338, 5.05426549911499, 4.278540134429932, 4.493851661682129, 5.2636003494262695, 4.3422651290893555, 4.271213054656982, 4.240713596343994, 5.657176971435547, 5.413147449493408, 4.134317874908447, 4.38275146484375, 4.500080108642578, 4.985753536224365, 4.954790115356445, 5.011937141418457, 5.359874248504639, 4.345519542694092, 5.623026371002197, 5.142884731292725, 4.676108360290527, 3.766042470932007, 6.213192462921143, 4.781494140625, 5.13548469543457, 5.200783729553223, 4.260495185852051, 4.250739097595215, 5.246287822723389, 0.0]}]}
